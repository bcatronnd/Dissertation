Acoustic waves are isentropic compression waves with the fluctuating pressure, $p'$, determining the strength of the wave.
This fluctuating pressure is related to the sound pressure level, $\spl$ by
\begin{equation}
  \spl = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{p_{rms}}{p_0}\right)
  \label{eqn:03_spl}
\end{equation}
where $p_{rms}$ is the root mean square of the pressure fluctuation, and $p_0$ is the reference pressure (20 $\mu$Pa for air).
The pressure fluctuations can be converted to the density fluctuations via the definition of the speed of sound:
\begin{equation}
  c_0^2 = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\right)_s=\frac{p'}{\rho'}
  \label{eqn:03_speed_sound}
\end{equation}
where $c_0$ is the speed of sound at mean fluid properties and the subscript $s$ denotes constant entropy.
It can be shown by combining Equations \ref{eqn:02_gladstone_dale_relation_fluctuating} and \ref{eqn:02_opd} that the fluctuating density can be related to the $\opd$,
\begin{equation}
  \opd = K_{GD}\int_{s_1}^{s_2}{\rho'}ds \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_fluct}
\end{equation}
This can be combined with Equation \ref{eqn:03_speed_sound},
\begin{equation}
  \opd = \frac{K_{GD}}{c_0^2}\int_{s_1}^{s_2}{p'}ds \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_pressure}
\end{equation}
to provide a way of computing the optical path difference of a pressure field.

When the pressure field is known in complex quantities (magnitude and phase), a complex optical path difference can calculated,
\begin{equation}
  \widehat{\opd}(x,y) = \frac{K_{GD}}{c_0^2}\int_{z_1}^{z_2} \hat{p}(x,y,z)dz \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_complex}
\end{equation}
Here the complex pressure field was assumed to be seperable in time and space.
The measurable $\opd$ is
\begin{equation}
  \opd(x,y) = \real\left[\sum\widehat{\opd}(x,y)\exp\{j\omega t\}\right] \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_real}
\end{equation}
This can greatly reduce the computational cost of simulating a beam passing through a pressue or density field that is separable in time and space by only performing the spatial integration once for each temporal frequency component.

\section{Simple Examples of Acoustic-Optical Coupling}
Two basic acoustic pressure fields will be numerically examined for their optical properties.
The first will be a planar acoustic wave that will be numerically simulated over a variety of conditions.
The second will be a spherical acoustic wave that will be both numerically simulated and validated experimentally.

\subsection{Planar Acoustic Waves}
A planar wave is the simplest solution to the wave equation and varies only in time and the direction of travel.
A planar wave can be calculated from the set of solutions for duct acoustics, Equation \ref{eqn:02_pressure_solution_duct}, given that $\Psi_m(x,y)=1$,
\begin{equation}
  \hat{p}(z,t) = p_m\exp\left\{j(\omega t \mp k_{zm}^\pm z)\right\} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:03_plane_wave}
\end{equation}
This section will show several plots to show the effect that acoustic waves have on the optical wavefront of a planar wave with the general geometry shown in Figure \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_domain}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/planar_sample_domain.eps}
  \caption{General geometry for various sample calculations for showing the acoustic-optical coupling effect.}
  \label{fig:03_planar_sample_domain}
\end{figure}
For the following example, $l_n$ is the width of the acoustic disturbance (for example, the width of the wind tunnel), $\theta$ is the angle between the planar acoustic wave and the beam direction, $A_p$ is the aperture diameter of the beam, and $\Lambda$ is the wavelength of the acoustic wave.

Figure \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3} shows the time averaged $\opdrms$ per meter of beam propagation when the beam path is parallel ($\theta=0$) to the peaks and troughs of the planar acoustic wave as $\spl$ is varied.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/planar_sample_calc_3.eps}
  \caption{Theoretical time-averaged $\opdrms$ per meter of beam propagation as a function of sound pressure level, $\spl$, for several $\Lambda/Ap$ ratios and $\theta=0$.}
  \label{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3}
\end{figure}
As the sound pressure level increases the time averaged $\opdrms$ also increases and can easily reach the point of being a significant factor in the measured optical disturbance.
There is little difference between 0.1 and 1 $\Lambda/Ap$, but as the wavelength gets much larger compared to the beam diameter, then the optical effect of the noise is greatly reduced, this effect is known as aperture filtering \cite{Siegenthaler-2005-KQ2HGmfp}.

Aperture filtering is more clearly shown in Figure \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/planar_sample_calc_1.eps}
  \caption{Theoretical time-averaged $\opdrms$ for a rms sound pressure of 1 Pa ($\spl$ of 94 dB), $l_n$ of 1 m, and various angles and $\Lambda/Ap$ ratios.}
  \label{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1}
\end{figure}
As the $\Lambda/Ap$ ratio increases from 0.1, time-averaged $\opdrms$ remains fairly constant until it starts to drop around $\Lambda/Ap$ of 0.7 and starts to asymptotically approach zero which it basically reaches by $\Lambda/Ap$ of 10.
Figure \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1} also shows the effect of changing the beam angle, $\theta$, through the acoustic field.
For nonzero $\theta$, the beam encounters alternating high and low index of refraction as it passes through the test region, so that the time-averaged $\opdrms$ begins to decrease compared to the $\theta = 0^\circ$ case below $\Lambda/Ap=1$.
There are also points of zero optical disturbance that occur at $\theta_{zero}=\tan^{-1}(n\Lambda/l_n)$ for $n\neq0$; these points occur because the peaks and valleys of the optical disturbance caused by the sound wave effectively cancel out over the length of the integration path, $l_n/\cos\theta$.

Figures \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3} and \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1} show the optical effect of plane acoustic waves in a no-flow environment.
The effect of wind-tunnel flow is to stretch (downstream-traveling waves) or compress (upstream-traveling waves) the wavelength of the acoustic noise thereby altering the filtering effect of the beam aperture.
Figure \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_2} shows a typical optical disturbance from the two transverse acoustic waves (u+c and u-c) present in a wind tunnel at Mach 0.6.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/planar_sample_calc_2.eps}
  \caption{Theoretical time-averaged $\opdrms$ for the two acoustic waves (u+c and u-c) for the blade pass frequency (534 Hz) at Mach 0.6 with a RMS sound pressure of 1 Pa ($\spl$ of 94 dB), $l_n$ of 1 m, and $Ap$ of 15 cm.}
  \label{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_2}
\end{figure}
Both waves have a RMS sound pressure of 1 Pa and the beam has an aperture of 15 cm and propagates through a 1 m acoustic field inside the tunnel.
Over a vast majority of the look back angles the upstream-traveling acoustic wave has a much greater effect on the optical disturbance compared to the downstream-traveling acoustic wave, due to the much shorter wavelength of the upstream-traveling waves which is less affected by aperture filtering.
However, the upstream-traveling wave goes through several zero points so the downstream-traveling wave dominates at some look back angles.

% In summary, Figures \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3} to \ref{fig:03_planar_sample_calc_2} give an example of how planar acoustic waves are expected to affect a beam traveling a finite distance $l_n$ at an angle $\theta$ through the acoustic field.

\subsection{Spherical Acoustic Waves}
The acoustic field from an speaker maybe assumed to be a spherical wave from a pulsating sphere if the frequency is sufficiently low and measurement region is far enough away from the source \cite{Randall-1951-9NtPPXPq}.

\begin{equation}
  \hat{p}(r,t) = \frac{A_0}{r}\exp\left\{-j(kr-\omega t)\right\}
  \label{eqn:03_spherical_pressure}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  p_{rms} = \frac{|A_0|}{r\sqrt{2}}
  \label{eqn:03_spherical_pressure_rms}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\opdrms\sqrt{R/Ap}}{|A_0|} \approx \frac{p_1(\Lambda/Ap)^2+p_2(\Lambda/Ap)+p_3}{(\Lambda/Ap)^2+q_1(\Lambda/Ap)+q_2}
