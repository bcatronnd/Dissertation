\chapter{Multiple Sensor Filtering Techniques}
\label{chap:07_multiple_filter}

The previous chapter investigated filtering optical wavefront corruption by applying a variety of filters to the wavefront in the multi-dimensional spectral domain.
These techniques involve only data from the optical wavefront itself and user knowledge and experience to obtain filtered data.
When additional data streams are available, such as from microphones or accelerators, intelligent targeted filter mechanisms become available.
