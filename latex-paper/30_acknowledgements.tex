I would like to thank my advisors R. Mark Rennie and Eric J. Jumper along with Stanislav Gordeyev for helping me grow not only in my ability to take measurements, but also as a researcher, designing experiments and analyzing the data.
I would also like to think my fellow grad students, particularly Jon Wells, Barry Pawlowski, Matt Kalensky, and Matt Kemnetz, who endured alongside me.
You helped me when I needed help and gave me some interesting problems to solve.

Most of all I would like to thank my family.
My parents, Kevin and Nila, who pushed me to meet my potential when I was younger.
I would like to think you for the sacrifices you made for my benefit.
Thank you Karen, my wife, for putting up with my slow progress at times.
Thank you for everything you do for me and our child.
Arthur, watching you grow and learn brings me joy everyday.
% Elizabeth, I will always miss you and will have an emptiness from never having the opportunity to hold you.
