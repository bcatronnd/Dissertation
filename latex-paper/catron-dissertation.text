Introduction {#chap:01_intro}
============

[FINISHED]{style="color: red"}

There have been two major attempts to field a directed-energy system
aboard an aircraft to date [@Jumper-2013-8KtN3pue]. The first was the
Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) which took place in the late 1970's and
early 1980's which used a CO$_2$ laser with a wavelength of 10.6-$\mu$m.
The second was the Airborne Laser (ABL) program which operated in the
2000's and used a COIL laser at 1.315-$\mu$m. Airborne optical systems
like ALL and ABL have to deal with a phenomenon known as "aero-optics,"
which refers to optical distortions caused by compressible aero-dynamic
flow features that pass through the outgoing beam. These optical
distortions were first noticed due to image degradation in wind tunnel
measurements in the 1950's [@Stine-1956-UaRzVZCe] as well as in
photo-reconnaissance missions in the 1960's [@Kyrazis-2013-vwKeEBym].

The peak on-target irradiance of a beam passing through an optical
disturbance, $I$, divided by the diffraction-limited performance, $I_0$,
is known as the Strehl ratio [@Mahajan-1982-kkXM4eaB], $\sr$,
$$\sr = \frac{I}{I_0} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:01_strehl_ratio_definition}$$ The diffraction-limited
performance is the beam intensity that would exist on the same target if
not for the optical disturbance. The Airborne Laser Laboratory had an
estimated Strehl ratio of 95%[@Jumper-2013-8KtN3pue] so that the
"aero-optics problem" effectively did not apply for this case. Following
the Airborne Laser Laboratory program there was a desire to move toward
shorter wavelengths in order to take advantage of improved
diffraction-limited performance, leading to a smaller-diameter focused
spot on target with a higher irradiance $I_0$: [@Jumper-2001-6QDh7zDy],
$$\frac{I_0}{P} = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\frac{Ap}{\lambda z}\right)^2 \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:01_farfield_intensity}$$ where $P$ is the laser output
power, $Ap$ is the aperture size, and $z$ is the propagation distance.
The improvement in diffraction-limited performance as the laser
wavelength is decreased is shown in Figure
[\[fig:01\_farfield\_intensity\]](#fig:01_farfield_intensity){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:01_farfield_intensity"}.

![Diffraction-limited far-field intensity of a beam normalized by the
performance at
1-$\mu$m.](../matlab/01_introduction/farfield_intensity.eps)

[\[fig:01\_farfield\_intensity\]]{#fig:01_farfield_intensity
label="fig:01_farfield_intensity"}

By only changing the laser source from a 10-$\mu$m to 1-$\mu$m
wavelength the diffraction-limited performance can be increased 100
times.

Aero-optical issues start to become important as the wavelength is
decreased as is evident from the Maréchal approximation
[@Mahajan-1983-hg7ahvJM] which relates the Strehl ratio to wavelength,
$$\sr \approx \exp\left\{-\left[\frac{2\pi \opdrms}{\lambda}\right]^2\right\} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:01_strehl_ratio}$$ where $\opdrms$ is the spatial
root-mean-square of the optical path difference over the aperture and is
a way to quantify the optical disturbance as will be discussed further
in Chapter [2](#chap:02_lit_review){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:02_lit_review"}. As stated above, the ALL had a Strehl
ratio of 95%; however, if the ALL system's laser was swapped with
another laser of a lower wavelength, the Strehl ratio would
significantly decrease as shown by Figure
[\[fig:01\_strehl\_ratio\]](#fig:01_strehl_ratio){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:01_strehl_ratio"}.

![Strehl ratio due to the $\opdrms$ of the Airborne Laser Laboratory
(ALL) at various laser wavelengths. ALL had an estimated Strehl ratio of
95% with its 10.6-$\mu$m
laser.](../matlab/01_introduction/strehl_ratio.eps)

[\[fig:01\_strehl\_ratio\]]{#fig:01_strehl_ratio
label="fig:01_strehl_ratio"}

While going from 10 to 1-$\mu$m hypothetically results in a 100-fold
increase in diffraction-limited performance, the actual on-target
intensity that this hypothetical system obtains would be essentially
zero due to the much larger effect that aero-optical aberrations have on
the outgoing beam as the wavelength is reduced. This means that the
aero-optical problem can no longer be ignored, which was recognized as
one of the main developmental risks of the ABL program
[@DOTE-1999-HnkadUEw].

As the next generation of airborne directed-energy systems are developed
some amount of ground testing of those systems will need to occur. In
order to understand the aero-optical environment that these systems will
experience in the air, wind tunnel tests will need to be employed. These
tests are cheaper to perform than, for example, flight testing, and
allow for quicker iteration of design parameters. However, as will be
described in further detail in Chapter
[2](#chap:02_lit_review){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:02_lit_review"}, wind-tunnel measurements of
aero-optical effects typically require passing a test beam into and
through the test-section, so that the test beam is susceptible to
acquiring additional optical contamination including but not limited to
the boundary layer present on the wall and the acoustic environment
generated by the wind tunnel fan [@Gordeyev-2014-jcJndkHM]. Note that it
is common in signal-processing terminology to use the word "noise" to
describe unwanted interference that appears in addition to the "signal"
that is the objective of the measurement; however, in this dissertation,
the word "contamination" is used to describe any optical noise sources
that are unrelated to the aero-optical signal, in order to avoid
confusion with use of the word "noise" to describe acoustic noise which,
as will be shown, is also a source of optical contamination.

Assuming that the optical disturbances from aero-optical effects are
statistically independent from the contaminating optical disturbances
from the testing environment, we can estimate the total optical
disturbance as
$$\opdrms_{TOTAL}^2 = \opdrms_{MODEL}^2+\opdrms_{ENVIRONMENT}^2 \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:01_combined_opd}$$ an example of the effect that optical
contamination may have on system design, Figure
[\[fig:01\_design\_iteration\]](#fig:01_design_iteration){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:01_design_iteration"} illustrates a hypothetical
iterative design process, where the design objective is to obtain a
design that meets a required level of performance shown in red, in the
presence of a level of environmental optical contamination shown in
orange.

![Hypothetical iterative design process of an airborne directed-energy
system. The required performance level is shown by the red line and the
testing environment's contamination is shown by the orange
line.](../matlab/01_introduction/design_iteration.eps)

[\[fig:01\_design\_iteration\]]{#fig:01_design_iteration
label="fig:01_design_iteration"}

The design process was simulated by an initial aero-optical $\opdrms$
shown on the left of the plot, and the improvement in system performance
achieved with each design iteration was simulated as a nearly linear
reduction in $\opdrms$ combined with 15% random variation. If only the
measured data, that is, including the effect of environmental
contamination using Equation
[\[eqn:01\_combined\_opd\]](#eqn:01_combined_opd){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:01_combined_opd"}, is used to assess the system's
performance then three additional design iterations are needed to
achieve a usable design, which can add significantly to the development
time and costs. If the environmental contamination is greater than the
design requirement, the measured performance will never reach the
required performance criteria. However, if the environmental
contamination can be estimated, mitigated and/or removed, then the
measured performance is a more accurate evaluation of the true
aero-optical performance, and design convergence can be achieved more
quickly and with more accurate results.

This dissertation will examine the environmental contamination of
aero-optical measurements in wind tunnels, with a particular focus on
the contamination due to acoustic noise within the wind tunnel. A review
of the available literature and important concepts in given in Chapter
[2](#chap:02_lit_review){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:02_lit_review"}. In Chapter
[3](#chap:03_optical_acoustics){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:03_optical_acoustics"}, the optical disturbances caused
by acoustic waves from simple plane and spherical waves are presented,
leading to a process for estimating the acoustical environment within
the test section of a wind tunnel. The strength of an spherical acoustic
wave will be assessed with both microphone and optical measurements.
Multi-dimensional spectral techniques will be used to analyze optical
wavefronts in Chapter [4](#chap:04_dispersion){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:04_dispersion"} and to filter optical wavefronts in
Chapter [6](#chap:06_single_filter){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:06_single_filter"}. These filtering techniques will
contain some optical contamination particularly in regions where the
various signal components interfere with one another. In order to
further reduce the optical contamination, Chapter
[7](#chap:07_multiple_filter){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:07_multiple_filter"} will utilize additional sensor
information from both microphones and accelerometers to remove some of
the overlapping contamination to obtain a better picture of the actual
optical performance of an airborne directed-energy system from ground
test measurements.

Literature Review {#chap:02_lit_review}
=================

The literature review will consist of primarily two sections. The first
section will examine aero-optics while the second will look at acoustics
inside of ducts.

Aero-Optics
-----------

Optical communication and directed energy systems require a tightly
focused beam on target in order to meet system performance objectives.
The farfield performance of airborne optical systems can be degraded by
the nearfield flow that becomes optically active at compressible flow
speeds. "Aero-optics" is the study of the optical effect of these
nearfield flow disturbances. Examples of important aero-optical flows
that have been studied extensively include boundary layers
[@Gordeyev-2014-jcJndkHM; @Smith-2013-VXArwwux; @Wang-2012-gJ7rttg7],
shear layers [@Fitzgerald-2004-DgAgbreK; @Rennie-2008-Wku6NheG], shock
waves [@Jumper-2013-8KtN3pue], and even tip vortices
[@Porter-2013-pQcNWHJ6]. The effect of acoustic disturbances on
aero-optical measurements has also been shown in both flight testing
[@DeLucca-2018-gBQdjTmT] and ground testing
[@Catron-2018-DdVp6VZf; @Catron-2020-x8njYmmu].

In these optically active flows the index-of-refraction, $n$, varies
locally as does the other fluid properties. Gladstone and Dale
[@Gladstone-1863-ND4wtDT9] found that the index-of-refraction is
primarily a function of density with a loose dependence on the
wavelength of light. Gladstone and Dale proposed a "specific refractive
energy" now known as the Gladstone-Dale constant, $K_{GD}$,
$$K_{GD} = \frac{n-1}{\rho}\textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_gladstone_dale_constant}$$ For air the refractive index
can be related to state quantities [@Valley-1965-F3k3cmv6]
$$n-1 = 77.6\times 10^{-6}\frac{P}{T}\left(1+\frac{7.53\times10^{-3}}{\lambda^2}\right)\textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_refractive_index_ptlambda}$$ where $P$ is in mbar, $T$
is in K, and $\lambda$ is in $\mu$m. By combining this relationship with
the ideal gas law, the Gladstone-Dale constant can be determined as a
function of light wavelength,
$$K_{GD} = 2.23\times10^{-4}\left(1+\frac{7.53\times10^{-3}}{\lambda_{\mu m}^2}\right) \: \left[\frac{m^3}{kg}\right]\textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_gladstone_dale_wavelength}$$ The Gladstone-Dale constant
for air over the visible range is shown in Figure
[\[fig:02\_gladstone\_dale\_wavelength\]](#fig:02_gladstone_dale_wavelength){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_gladstone_dale_wavelength"}.

![Gladstone-Dale constant for air over the visible wavelength
range.](../matlab/02_background/gladstone_dale_wavelength.eps)

[\[fig:02\_gladstone\_dale\_wavelength\]]{#fig:02_gladstone_dale_wavelength
label="fig:02_gladstone_dale_wavelength"}

While the value for $K_{GD}$ does vary over the visible range, it is
only a few percent, and many sources use an average value of
2.27$\times10^{-4}$ m$^3$/kg for the visible and near-infrared
[@Gardiner-1980-reW8xrCb]. The Gladstone-Dale relationship is typically
presented as $$n = 1+K_{GD}\rho
  \label{eqn:02_gladstone_dale_relation}$$ but when applied to
situations where there are significant fluctuations in the flow an
alternate form is often more useful $$n'=K_{GD}\rho'
  \label{eqn:02_gladstone_dale_relation_fluctuating}$$ where $'$ denotes
the quantity represents the fluctuating component ($n' = n-\bar{n}$).

When a beam with an initially planar wave front passes through a region
of optical active flow its wave front aberrated The optical path length
($\opl$) at any point in the beam can be obtained by integrating the
index of refraction along the propagation of an optical ray
[@Klein-1986-8Vx29RfE]. $$\opl (x,y,t) = \int^{s_2}_{s_1} n(x,y,z,t)ds
  \label{eqn:02_opl}$$ The optical path difference ($\opd$), is then the
spatially-averaged $\textrm{OPL}$ over an aperture removed from the OPL.
$$\opd(x,y,t) = \opl(x,y,t)-\langle\opl(x,y,t)\rangle
  \label{eqn:02_opd}$$ When working with fluctuating components, the
$\opd$ can be calculated directly
$$\opd(x,y,t) = \int^{s_2}_{s_1} n'(x,y,z,t)ds \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_opd_n}$$

When $\opd$ is combined with the beam intensity profile, one can compute
the farfield complex amplitude distribution using the Fraunhofer
approximation [@Goodman-1968-zPUmuuzx].
$$U(x_0,y_0,t)\propto\iint_{Ap}\exp\left\{\frac{2\pi j}{\lambda}\left[\opd(x_1,y_1,t)-\frac{(x_0x_1+y_0y_1)}{z}\right]\right\}dx_1dy_1
  \label{eqn:02_fraunhofer}$$ where $U$ is the complex amplitude, the
subscripts 0 and 1 represent the coordinates of the farfield and
nearfield respectively. The intensity can be computed from the complex
amplitude via: $I = UU^\ast$. For cases in which optical aberrations are
nonexistent (i.e. $\opd(x,y,t)=0$), the farfield irradiance pattern that
results from Equation
[\[eqn:02\_fraunhofer\]](#eqn:02_fraunhofer){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_fraunhofer"} is caused entirely by diffraction from
the optical aperture, and is referred to as the "diffraction-limited"
irradiance pattern. For a beam with a flat wave front and circular
aperture, the farfield irradiance pattern is the Airy's disk, and the
peak irradiance at the center of the disk, $I_0$ , is the maximum
irradiance that can be achieved by the optical system:
$$I_0 = \left(\frac{kAp^2}{8z}\right)^2
  \label{eqn:02_airy_pattern}$$ where $k$ is the wavenumber
($k=2\pi /\lambda$), $Ap$ is the aperture diameter, and $z$ is the
distance from the aperture. In the presence of aero-optical aberrations,
$\opd(x,y,t)$ is non-zero, and the farfield irradiance pattern in this
case tends to be more spread out and diffuse than the
diffraction-limited case; furthermore, the beam may be shifted off
target by optical tip/tilt imposed by the aberrations.

The Strehl ratio ($\sr$), is the ratio of intensity on target ($I$) to
the diffraction-limited on target intensity ($I_0$): $$\sr=\frac{I}{I_0}
  \label{eqn:02_strehl_simple}$$ The Strehl ratio can be computed
accurately by applying Equation
[\[eqn:02\_fraunhofer\]](#eqn:02_fraunhofer){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_fraunhofer"} twice, once for the diffraction-limited
case to obtain $I_0$, and a second time with the $\opd$ field due to
aero-optical aberrations included to obtain $I$. The farfield
performance, can also be estimated via the Maréchal approximation:
$$\sr(t) \equiv \frac{I(t)}{I_0} \approx \exp \left\{-\left[\frac{2\pi \opdrms(t)}{\lambda}\right]^2\right\}
  \label{eqn:02_strehl_ratio}$$ where $\opdrms$ is the spatial rms of
the wave front and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the beam.

Equation
[\[eqn:02\_strehl\_ratio\]](#eqn:02_strehl_ratio){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_strehl_ratio"} shows a key relationship between
$\opd$, wavelength, and the farfield performance, plotted in Figure
[\[fig:02\_all\_strehl\_ratio\]](#fig:02_all_strehl_ratio){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_all_strehl_ratio"}. On the other hand, Equation
[\[eqn:02\_airy\_pattern\]](#eqn:02_airy_pattern){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_airy_pattern"} shows that the diffraction-limited
farfield irradiance increases as the wavelength is shortened, plotted in
Figure
[\[fig:02\_farfield\_intensity\]](#fig:02_farfield_intensity){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_farfield_intensity"}. Together, Figure
[\[fig:02\_farfield\_intensity\]](#fig:02_farfield_intensity){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_farfield_intensity"} and
[\[fig:02\_all\_strehl\_ratio\]](#fig:02_all_strehl_ratio){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_all_strehl_ratio"} show that as modern optical systems
move to shorter wavelengths to increase $I_0$, aero-optical aberrations
cause a much more serious degradation of the Strehl ratio, illustrating
why aero-optical considerations are critical in the development of any
airborne optical system.

Figure
[\[fig:02\_necessary\_opd\]](#fig:02_necessary_opd){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_necessary_opd"} shows the $\opdrms$ necessary to
achieve various Strehl ratios over a range of wavelengths.

As the wavelength of light decreases the required $\opdrms$ decreases
linearly for a fixed Strehl ratio.

### A Brief History of Aero-Optics

The field of aero-optics began with an investigation by Liepmann
[@Liepmann-1952-89GQ7wyA] into the limits of sensitivity of schlieren
systems when used in high-speed flow analysis. Liepmann used geometric
optics to analyze a small-diameter beam and derive its mean-squared
fluctuating deflection angle, $\left<\theta^2\right>$. Liepmann
propagated the beam in the $y$ direction and assumed the index of
refraction changes in the $x-z$ plane were statistically similar.
Liepmann's analysis for a boundary layer of thickness $\delta$ resulted
in
$$\left<\theta^2\right> = \frac{1}{[n_0(\delta)]^2}\int_0^\delta\int_0^\delta n_0(y)n_0(\zeta)\left<\left(\frac{\partial\nu}{\partial y}\right)^2\right>R_v(|y-\zeta|)dyd\zeta
  \label{eqn:02_liepmann_deflection_angle}$$ where the index of
refraction is determined from $n=n_0(y)(1+\nu)$ and $R_v(|y-\zeta|)$ is
the correlation function for the index variation. This analysis
introduced the concept of a linking equation that allows one to predict
time-averaged optical degradation to turbulent flow statistical
measurements.

Acoustics
---------

### Basic Acoustics

Starting with the conservation of mass,
$$\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\left(\rho\mathbf{u}\right)=0  \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_cons_of_mass}$$ and separating the density into a
time-averaged ($\rho_0$) and fluctuating portion ($\rho'$),
$\rho = \rho_0+\rho'$. The fluctuating conservation of mass equation is
obtained by separating the density ($\rho = \rho_0+\rho'$) into a
temporally averaged density, $\rho_0$, and a

$$\frac{\mathbf{D}\rho'}{\mathbf{Dt}}+\nabla\cdot\left(\rho_0\mathbf{u}\right)=0
  \label{eqn:02_cons_of_mass_fluc}$$

For acoustics waves of frequency less than $10^9$ Hz the compression of
the fluid can be assumed to be adiabatic [@Morse-1968-yygEdQZf].

$$\left.\frac{\partial p}{\partial\rho}\right|_s = c_0^2
  \label{eqn:02_speed_of_sound}$$

### Duct Acoustics

Acoustic waves are often enclosed inside of somesort of structure. This
section will look at acoustics when confined to a duct in which the
acoustic waves primarily travel along one-axis and have walls confining
the acoustics along the other two axes as is the case inside of a wind
tunnel. Figure
[\[fig:02\_duct\_drawing\]](#fig:02_duct_drawing){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_duct_drawing"} shows the diagram used for deriving the
acoustic properties inside of a constant area duct.

![Duct with a rectangular
cross-section.](../autocad/02_background/duct_drawing.eps "fig:"){width="4.5in"}
(-155,62) (-227,113) (-103,119)$\mathbf{x}$ (-198,220)$\mathbf{y}$
(-26,4)$\mathbf{z}$

[\[fig:02\_duct\_drawing\]]{#fig:02_duct_drawing
label="fig:02_duct_drawing"}

This derivation is primarily influenced from Munjal
[@Munjal-2014-w28y4EyP] along with Jacobsen and Juhl
[@Jacobsen-2013-PHD3v3YZ]. The primary assumption used in this
derivation is that the duct is of constant cross-section. This means
that all mean quantities ($\rho_0$, $\mathbf{u_0}$, \...) a constant
throughout space and time. Starting with the linearized inviscid forms
of the conservation of mass,
$$\frac{\mathbf{D}\rho}{\mathbf{Dt}} + \rho_0\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = 0 \textrm{,}
  % \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\rho + \rho_0(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) = 0 \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_cons_mass}$$ and conservation of momentum,
$$\rho_0\frac{\mathbf{Du}}{\mathbf{Dt}} + \nabla p = 0 \textrm{.}
  % \rho_0\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \rho_0(\mathbf{u_0}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} + \nabla p = 0 \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_cons_mom}$$ The definition of the speed of sound
(Equation
[\[eqn:02\_speed\_of\_sound\]](#eqn:02_speed_of_sound){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_speed_of_sound"}) is then substituted into Equation
[\[eqn:02\_cons\_mass\]](#eqn:02_cons_mass){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_cons_mass"},
$$\frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\mathbf{D}p}{\mathbf{Dt}} + \rho_0\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = 0 \textrm{,}
  % \frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c_0^2}(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla p) + \rho_0(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) = 0 \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_cons_mass_p}$$ where $c_0$ is the speed of sound at
average fluid properties ($\rho_0$, $p_0$, $T_0$, \...). Next the
difference between the material derivative ($\mathbf{D}/\mathbf{Dt}$) of
Equation
[\[eqn:02\_cons\_mass\_p\]](#eqn:02_cons_mass_p){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_cons_mass_p"} and the partial derivative
($\partial/\partial\mathbf{x}$) of Equation
[\[eqn:02\_cons\_mom\]](#eqn:02_cons_mom){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_cons_mom"} with respect to space is taken which
results in the convected 3-D wave equation,
$$\left(\frac{\mathbf{D}^2}{\mathbf{Dt}^2}-c_0^2\nabla^2\right)p=0\textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_wave_conv_3_c}$$ Expanding the material derivative and
dividing by $c_0^2$,
$$\left(\frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + \frac{2\mathbf{M}}{c_0}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t\partial\mathbf{x}} - (1-\mathbf{M}^2)\nabla^2\right)p = 0 \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_wave_conv_expand}$$ where
$\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{u_0}/c_0$. By using the fact that
$c_0=\omega/k_0$, Equation
[\[eqn:02\_wave\_conv\_3\_c\]](#eqn:02_wave_conv_3_c){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_wave_conv_3_c"} can be written in a more convent form,
$$\left(\frac{1}{\omega^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + \frac{2\mathbf{M}}{\omega k_0}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t\partial\mathbf{x}} - \frac{1-\mathbf{M}^2}{k_0^2}\nabla^2\right)p = 0 \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_wave_conv_3}$$ where $\omega$ is the angular frequency
and $k_0$ is the total wavenumber.

At this point the pressure field is going to written in a complex form
and assumed to be separable in both time and space such that
$\hat{p}(\mathbf{x},t) = \hat{p}(x,y)\hat{p}(z)\hat{p}(t)$. The temporal
solution is assumed to take the form
$$\hat{p}(t) = \exp\left\{j\omega t\right\} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_pressure_solution_time}$$ This results in the spatial
component of the convecting wave equation
$$\left((1-\mathbf{M}^2)\nabla^2-2jk_0\mathbf{M}\nabla+k_0^2\right)\hat{p}(x,y)\hat{p}(z) = 0 \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_wave_conv_space}$$ This can be further split into axial
and cross-sectional components by splitting $k_0$ into components,
$$k_0 = \sqrt{k_{xy}^2+k_z^2} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_k0}$$ and because the mean flow is only in the axial
direction ($\mathbf{M} = M\mathbf{\hat{k}}$). The cross-sectional
component is a typical Helmholtz equation
$$\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right)\hat{p}_{xy}(x,y)+k_{xy}^2\hat{p}(x,y) = 0 \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_wave_xy}$$ whos solution,
$$\hat{p}(x,y) = \Psi_m(x,y) \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_pressure_solution_xy}$$ is one of infinity many
eigen-function solutions with discrete wavenumbers, $k_m$. The axial
component of the convecting wave equation,
$$(1-M^2)\frac{\partial^2\hat{p}(z)}{\partial z^2} - 2jk_0M\frac{\partial\hat{p}(z)}{\partial z} + k_z^2\hat{p}(z) = 0 \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_wave_z}$$ retains the total wavenumber in second term
which means its solution will depend on the cross-sectional wavenumber
value at cross-sectional mode. The solution to the axial convecting wave
equation,
$$\hat{p}(z) = p^+_m\exp{\left\{-jk^+_{zm}z\right\}}+p^-_m\exp{\left\{+jk^-_{zm}z\right\}} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_pressure_solution_z}$$ has waves traveling in both
directions with the axial wavenumber in each direction for a given mode
$$k^\pm_{zm} = \frac{\mp Mk_0+\sqrt{k_0^2-(1-M^2)k_m^2}}{1-M^2} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_kzm}$$

The solution for a three-dimensional acoustic wave in a duct with a
constant but arbitrary cross-section in complex pressure is the
combination of the component solutions presented in Equations
[\[eqn:02\_pressure\_solution\_time\]](#eqn:02_pressure_solution_time){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_pressure_solution_time"},
[\[eqn:02\_pressure\_solution\_xy\]](#eqn:02_pressure_solution_xy){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_pressure_solution_xy"}, and
[\[eqn:02\_pressure\_solution\_z\]](#eqn:02_pressure_solution_z){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_pressure_solution_z"},
$$\hat{p}(x,y,z,t) = \Psi_m(x,y)\left(p^+_m\exp{\left\{-jk^+_{zm}z\right\}}+p^-_m\exp{\left\{+jk^-_{zm}z\right\}}\right)\exp\left\{j\omega t\right\} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_pressure_solution_duct}$$ The two solutions for a plane
wave ($\Psi_m=1$, $k_m=0$) traveling in a duct have a characteristic
speed of $u\pm c_0$. Acoustic modes will travel indefinitly if
$k_0^2-(1-M^2)k_m^2>0$ (the quantity inside of the square-root of
Equation [\[eqn:02\_kzm\]](#eqn:02_kzm){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_kzm"}). This presents a frequency at which a given
mode will cut-on,
$$f_{cuton} = \frac{c_0}{2\pi}\sqrt{(1-M^2)k_m^2} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_cuton_freq}$$ Below this frequency, an acoustic mode
will be exponentially attenuated as it travels throught the duct.

#### Characteristic Equations of Cross-Sections

In order to determine the characteristic equations of an acoustic field
within a cross-section the solution to Equation
[\[eqn:02\_wave\_xy\]](#eqn:02_wave_xy){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_wave_xy"} needs to be determined. A typical boundary
condition that is used in the solution of this 2-D Helmholtz equation is
using the assumption that the walls are rigid.
$$\nabla p_{x,y}(x,y)\cdot\mathbf{n}_{wall} = 0
  \label{eqn:02_bc_rigig_wall}$$ This boundary condition results in the
acoustic waves being perfectly reflected off of the duct walls. There
are several known empirical solution sets of the characteristic
equations for specific geometry with the rigid wall assumption.

The first of these solutions is for a rectangular cross-section,
$$\Psi_{m,n}(x,y) = \cos(k_xx)\cos(k_yy) \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_psi_rect}$$ where the wave numbers along each axis are
$k_x = m\pi/l_x$ and $k_y = n\pi/l_y$. The duct has a width of $l_x$ and
a height of $l_y$. The total cross-sectional wave number for use in
determining the axial wave numbers is $$k_m^2 = k_x^2+k_y^2 \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:02_wave_number_crosssection}$$ Figure
[\[fig:02\_cross\_section\_rect\]](#fig:02_cross_section_rect){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_cross_section_rect"} shows the characteristic
functions when m=0:2 and n=0:3 for a rectangular cross-section of width
of $l_x$ and height of $l_y$.

![Characteristic solutions to Equation
[\[eqn:02\_wave\_xy\]](#eqn:02_wave_xy){reference-type="ref"

cross-section where m=0:2 and n=0:3. Nodal lines are depicted by the
dot-dash lines. The cross-sectional wave numbers, $k_m$, listed are for
a duct of unit length and
height.](../matlab/02_background/cross_section_rect.eps)

[\[fig:02\_cross\_section\_rect\]]{#fig:02_cross_section_rect
label="fig:02_cross_section_rect"}

The lines depicted in the figure are nodal lines and represent locations
where there is zero pressure fluctuations for that acoustic mode.

The second set of known empirical solutions is for a circular
cross-section with radius $R$,
$$\Psi_{m,n}(r,\theta) = J_m(k_{mn}r)\exp\left\{\pm jm\theta\right\} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:02_psi_circ}$$ where $J_m$ is the $m^\textrm{th}$ Bessel
function of the first kind and the $\pm$ indicates the direction of
spin. If the left and right spin coefficients are equal in magnitude
then a non-spinning mode is created. In order to satisfy the solid wall
boundary condition $J_m'(k_{mn}R) = 0$ which determines a set of
discrete values for the cross-sectional wave number at the
$n^\textrm{th}$ zero for the $m^\textrm{th}$ Bessel function. Figure
[\[fig:02\_cross\_section\_circ\]](#fig:02_cross_section_circ){reference-type="ref"

functions for a circular duct.

Aero-Optical and Acoustical Coupling {#chap:03_optical_acoustics}
====================================

-   Mode marching method

Acoustic waves are isentropic compression waves with the fluctuating
pressure, $p'$, determining the strength of the wave. This fluctuating
pressure is related to the sound pressure level, $\spl$ by
$$\spl = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{p_{rms}}{p_0}\right)
  \label{eqn:03_spl}$$ where $p_{rms}$ is the root mean square of the
pressure fluctuation, and $p_0$ is the reference pressure (20 $\mu$Pa
for air). The pressure fluctuations can be converted to the density
fluctuations via the definition of the speed of sound:
$$c_0^2 = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\right)_s=\frac{p'}{\rho'}
  \label{eqn:03_speed_sound}$$ where $c_0$ is the speed of sound at mean
fluid properties and the subscript $s$ denotes constant entropy. It can
be shown by combining Equations
[\[eqn:02\_gladstone\_dale\_relation\_fluctuating\]](#eqn:02_gladstone_dale_relation_fluctuating){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_gladstone_dale_relation_fluctuating"} and
[\[eqn:02\_opd\]](#eqn:02_opd){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_opd"} that the fluctuating density can be related to
the $\opd$, $$\opd = K_{GD}\int_{s_1}^{s_2}{\rho'}ds \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_fluct}$$ This can be combined with Equation
[\[eqn:03\_speed\_sound\]](#eqn:03_speed_sound){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:03_speed_sound"},
$$\opd = \frac{K_{GD}}{c_0^2}\int_{s_1}^{s_2}{p'}ds \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_pressure}$$ to provide a way of computing the
optical path difference of a pressure field.

Simulating an Optical Wavefront Measurement from an Acoustic Field Function {#chap:03_simulated_beam}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

An optical wavefront can be simulated from a complex pressure field by
applying Equation
[\[eqn:03\_opd\_pressure\]](#eqn:03_opd_pressure){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:03_opd_pressure"}. To accomplish this, two separate
coordinate systems will need to be defined. The first is the beam
coordinate system, $\mathbf{x}_B$, that will have a measurement
aperture, which is typically circular, defined in the xy-plane and
propagates in the z-direction. The second is the acoustic coordinate
system, $\mathbf{x}_A$, that will be defined based on the source
location or the geometry that the acoustic waves are propagating
through. These to coordinate systems will have a function representing a
transform from one to the other
$$\mathbf{x}_A = R\mathbf{x}_B+T \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:03_coord_transform}$$ where $R$ is a matrix which
represents the rotation and $T$ is a vector that represents the
translation.

The important parameters for defining the aperture which the beam
coordinate system is based are the aperture size, $Ap$, and the number
of lenslets or sub-apertures, $N_{lenslets}$. Assuming that the aperture
is either circular or square and the lenslet size and sub-aperture size
is approximately $Ap/N_{lenslets}$, the x locations of the center of the
sub-apertures go from $-Ap/2(1-1/N_{lenslets})$ to
$Ap/2(1-1/N_{lenslets})$ by steps of $Ap/N_{lenslets}$ with the y
locations having the same values. This gives a matrix representing both
$x_{Ap}$ and $y_{Ap}$ that is $N_{lenslets}$ by $N_{lenslets}$. For the
purpose of removing piston, tip, and tilt and creating a mask that
represents the beam aperture, the radial coordinates, $\rho_{Ap}$ and
$\theta_{Ap}$, of the aperture should also be calculated. A circular
beam will have a mask defined by, $$Mask_{Ap} =
  \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if } \rho_{Ap}\leq Ap/2 \\
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}$$ The beam coordinate frame is the aperture coordinates
extruded in the z-direction over the range of desired z-values.

After the beam coordinates are transformed into the acoustic coordinates
using Equation
[\[eqn:03\_coord\_transform\]](#eqn:03_coord_transform){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:03_coord_transform"}, the complex pressure field,
$\hat{p}(x,y,z,t)$ can be calculated at the points that are within the
optical beam. If the pressure field is separable into spatial and
temporal components, than the integration along the beam length only
needs to be done once for each temporal frequency,
$$\widehat{\opd}(x,y) = \frac{K_{GD}}{c_0^2}\int_{z_1}^{z_2} \hat{p}(x,y,z)_{Ap}dz \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_complex}$$ where $\widehat{\opd}(x,y)$ is the
complex optical path difference as measured in the aperture plane. If a
complex density field is known instead, than Equation
[\[eqn:03\_opd\_complex\]](#eqn:03_opd_complex){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:03_opd_complex"} becomes
$$\widehat{\opd}(x,y) = K_{GD}\int_{z_1}^{z_2} \hat{\rho}(x,y,z)_{Ap}dz \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_complex_density}$$ For the purposes of calculating
temporally mean optical properties of simulated beam passing through a
known complex pressure or density field a phase vector was defined,
$\phi = [0, 2\pi)$. The measurable component as a function of phase is
$$\opd(x,y,\phi) = \real\left[\widehat{\opd}(x,y)\exp\{-j\phi\}\right] \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_real_phase}$$ or as a function of time for all
temporal frequencies,
$$\opd(x,y,t) = \real\left[\sum\widehat{\opd}(x,y)\exp\{-j\omega t\}\right] \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:03_opd_real}$$ where there is a separate
$\widehat{\opd}(x,y)$ computed for each temporal frequency. One of the
more important measurements that can be calculated from $\opd$ is the
spatial RMS, $\opdrms$, which is calculated at each time or phase step
at the points where the aperture mask equals one.

Simple Examples of Acoustic-Optical Coupling
--------------------------------------------

Two basic acoustic pressure fields will be numerically examined for
their optical properties. The first will be a planar acoustic wave that
will be numerically simulated over a variety of conditions. The second
will be a spherical acoustic wave that will be both numerically
simulated and validated experimentally.

### Planar Acoustic Waves

A planar wave is the simplest solution to the wave equation and varies
only in time and the direction of travel. A planar wave can be
calculated from the set of solutions for duct acoustics, Equation
[\[eqn:02\_pressure\_solution\_duct\]](#eqn:02_pressure_solution_duct){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:02_pressure_solution_duct"}, given that $\Psi_m(x,y)=1$,
$$\hat{p}(z,t) = p_m\exp\left\{j(\omega t \mp k_{zm}^\pm z)\right\} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:03_plane_wave}$$ This section will show several plots to
show the effect that acoustic waves have on the optical wavefront of a
planar wave with the general geometry shown in Figure
[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_domain\]](#fig:03_planar_sample_domain){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_planar_sample_domain"}.

![General geometry for various sample calculations for showing the
acoustic-optical coupling
effect.](../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/planar_sample_domain.eps)

[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_domain\]]{#fig:03_planar_sample_domain
label="fig:03_planar_sample_domain"}

For the following example, $l_n$ is the width of the acoustic
disturbance (for example, the width of the wind tunnel), $\theta$ is the
angle between the planar acoustic wave and the beam direction, $A_p$ is
the aperture diameter of the beam, and $\Lambda$ is the wavelength of
the acoustic wave.

Figure
[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_3\]](#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3"} shows the time averaged
$\opdrms$ per meter of beam propagation when the beam path is parallel
($\theta=0$) to the peaks and troughs of the planar acoustic wave as
$\spl$ is varied.

![Theoretical time-averaged $\opdrms$ per meter of beam propagation as a
function of sound pressure level, $\spl$, for several $\Lambda/Ap$
ratios and
$\theta=0$.](../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/planar_sample_calc_3.eps)

[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_3\]]{#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3
label="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3"}

As the sound pressure level increases the time averaged $\opdrms$ also
increases and can easily reach the point of being a significant factor
in the measured optical disturbance. There is little difference between
0.1 and 1 $\Lambda/Ap$, but as the wavelength gets much larger compared
to the beam diameter, then the optical effect of the noise is greatly
reduced, this effect is known as aperture filtering
[@Siegenthaler-2005-KQ2HGmfp].

Aperture filtering is more clearly shown in Figure
[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_1\]](#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1"}.

![Theoretical time-averaged $\opdrms$ for a rms sound pressure of 1 Pa
($\spl$ of 94 dB), $l_n$ of 1 m, and various angles and $\Lambda/Ap$
ratios.](../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/planar_sample_calc_1.eps)

[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_1\]]{#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1
label="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1"}

As the $\Lambda/Ap$ ratio increases from 0.1, time-averaged $\opdrms$
remains fairly constant until it starts to drop around $\Lambda/Ap$ of
0.7 and starts to asymptotically approach zero which it basically
reaches by $\Lambda/Ap$ of 10. Figure
[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_1\]](#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1"} also shows the effect of
changing the beam angle, $\theta$, through the acoustic field. For
nonzero $\theta$, the beam encounters alternating high and low index of
refraction as it passes through the test region, so that the
time-averaged $\opdrms$ begins to decrease compared to the
$\theta = 0^\circ$ case below $\Lambda/Ap=1$. There are also points of
zero optical disturbance that occur at
$\theta_{zero}=\tan^{-1}(n\Lambda/l_n)$ for $n\neq0$; these points occur
because the peaks and valleys of the optical disturbance caused by the
sound wave effectively cancel out over the length of the integration
path, $l_n/\cos\theta$.

Figures
[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_3\]](#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_3"} and
[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_1\]](#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_1"} show the optical effect of
plane acoustic waves in a no-flow environment. The effect of wind-tunnel
flow is to stretch (downstream-traveling waves) or compress
(upstream-traveling waves) the wavelength of the acoustic noise thereby
altering the filtering effect of the beam aperture. Figure
[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_2\]](#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_2"} shows a typical optical
disturbance from the two transverse acoustic waves (u+c and u-c) present
in a wind tunnel at Mach 0.6.

![Theoretical time-averaged $\opdrms$ for the two acoustic waves (u+c
and u-c) for the blade pass frequency (534 Hz) at Mach 0.6 with a RMS
sound pressure of 1 Pa ($\spl$ of 94 dB), $l_n$ of 1 m, and $Ap$ of 15
cm.](../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/planar_sample_calc_2.eps)

[\[fig:03\_planar\_sample\_calc\_2\]]{#fig:03_planar_sample_calc_2
label="fig:03_planar_sample_calc_2"}

Both waves have a RMS sound pressure of 1 Pa and the beam has an
aperture of 15 cm and propagates through a 1 m acoustic field inside the
tunnel. Over a vast majority of the look back angles the
upstream-traveling acoustic wave has a much greater effect on the
optical disturbance compared to the downstream-traveling acoustic wave,
due to the much shorter wavelength of the upstream-traveling waves which
is less affected by aperture filtering. However, the upstream-traveling
wave goes through several zero points so the downstream-traveling wave
dominates at some look back angles.

### Spherical Acoustic Waves

The acoustic field from an speaker maybe assumed to be a spherical wave
from a pulsating point if the frequency is sufficiently low and
measurement region is far enough away from the source
[@Randall-1951-9NtPPXPq]. This pressure field when converted to complex
pressure is represented by
$$\hat{p}(r,t) = \frac{A_0}{r}\exp\left\{-j(kr-\omega t)\right\} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:03_spherical_pressure}$$ where $A_0$ is the fluctuating
pressure strength and $r$ is the distance from the source to the
measurement point. The RMS pressure of this field can be represented by
$$p_{rms} = \frac{|A_0|}{r\sqrt{2}} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:03_spherical_pressure_rms}$$

#### Theoretical OPD Measurements

A set of optical properties where calculated for a beam passing through
a spherical acoustic field as defined by a point source using the
process described previously in Chapter
[3.1](#chap:03_simulated_beam){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:03_simulated_beam"}. These calculations used an circular
aperture size of 0.25-m in diameter consisting of 32x32 sub-apertures,
an acoustic wavelength, $\Lambda$, of $Ap/4$ to $10Ap$, and a distance
from the point source to the center of the aperture, $R$, of $5Ap$ to
$25Ap$. The beam was integrated over $\pm5$-m from the plane of the
point source with 25 phase step used to calculate mean values.

The result of these simulated acoustic fields is shown in Figure
[\[fig:03\_spherical\_sample\]](#fig:03_spherical_sample){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_spherical_sample"}.

![Theoretical time-averaged $\opdrms$ for a spherical acoustic wave. The
top plot shows a perfect spherical acoustic signal integrated over
$\pm$5-m. The bottom plot shows has a Tukey window applied along the
beam length to partially emulate source directivity which significantly
reduces the measured
oscillations.](../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/spherical_sample.eps "fig:")
![Theoretical time-averaged $\opdrms$ for a spherical acoustic wave. The

oscillations.](../matlab/03_aero_optics_acoustics/spherical_sample_win.eps "fig:")

[\[fig:03\_spherical\_sample\]]{#fig:03_spherical_sample
label="fig:03_spherical_sample"}

The top plots shows the expected optical disturbance ratio,
$\opdrms/|A_0|$, for a perfectly spherical acoustic field measured over
the beam length. With the exception of some oscillations that are caused
by end effects in the integration. The oscillations can be greatly
reduced by using a windowing function in the z-direction such as a
Hanning or Tukey window which also can be used to roughly model
directivity of the speaker's acoustic emission as shown in the bottom
plot. While this plot was calculated with a single aperture diameter,
the general trend holds for all other aperture diameters that were
tested, the only effect was the size and width of the oscillations.

The peak of the optical disturbance ratio, $\opdrms/|A_0|$, is located
at $\Lambda/Ap\approx0.75$ for a circular aperture. The signal is
reduced above this value due to aperture filtering and below this value
because the shorter wavelength have a reduced distance before
alternating high and low index-of-refraction regions reduce the optical
path difference. When the acoustic source point is sufficiently far
enough away from the measurement beam, $R/Ap\geq2$, the optical
disturbance ratio, $\opdrms/|A_0|$ when multiplied by $\sqrt{R/Ap}$, can
be collapsed onto a single curve for a range of $\Lambda/Ap$ of 0.1 to
10. Above $\Lambda/Ap=10$ the curves start to diverge away from one
another. An approximate function fit to this data is
$$\frac{\opdrms\sqrt{R/Ap}}{|A_0|} \approx \frac{p_1(\Lambda/Ap)^3+p_2(\Lambda/Ap)^2+p_3(\Lambda/Ap)+p_4}{(\Lambda/Ap)^3+q_1(\Lambda/Ap)^2+q_2(\Lambda/Ap)+q_3}
  \label{eqn:03_spherical_sample_fit}$$ with coefficient values shown

#### Measurement of a Spherical Acoustic Wave with an Optical Beam

A small bench top experiment was used to compare the simultaneous
optical and microphone measurements of an acoustic field from a speaker
as shown in the measurement plane in Figure
[\[fig:03\_speaker\_test\]](#fig:03_speaker_test){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:03_speaker_test"}.

![Spherical acoustic wave measurement
test.](../cad/speak_test.pdf){width="3.5in"}

[\[fig:03\_speaker\_test\]]{#fig:03_speaker_test
label="fig:03_speaker_test"}

The distance from center of the beam to the speaker was 102-mm with a
beam diameter of 28-mm. An ACO model 7016B microphone [@ACO-Microphones]
was placed directly over the speaker at a distance of 158-mm and was
used with a Brüel & Kjær model 2670 preamplifier [@Bruel-Kjaer-2670].
The speaker in use was Peerless model XT25SC90-04
[@Peerless-XT25SC90-04-1] which has a fairly flat on-axis response from
1-kHz to 40kHz.

The wavefront measurements system utilized in these measurements is
similar to that shown in Figure
[\[fig:02\_typical\_wavefront\_system\]](#fig:02_typical_wavefront_system){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:02_typical_wavefront_system"} except there was no primary
telescope. The speaker was located in the center of the measurement
region which was about 2-feet in length and the re-imaging telescope
reduced the beam diameter by a factor of two and re-imaged the return
mirror. Optical wavefronts and microphone measurements were taken at
49-kHz. The speaker was sinusoidally excited at three different
frequencies (9, 14, and 18-kHz) at a variety of voltages.

The absolute value of the fluctuating pressure strength, $|A_0|$, was
calculated two different ways. The power spectra of the microphone data
was used to calculate the average $p_{rms}$ at the excitation frequency
and the fluctuating pressure strength using Equation
[\[eqn:03\_spherical\_pressure\_rms\]](#eqn:03_spherical_pressure_rms){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:03_spherical_pressure_rms"}. The optical wavefront was
band-pass filtered at the excitation frequency using a process that will
be discussed in Chapter [\[chap:06\]](#chap:06){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:06"}. The time averaged $\opdrms$ was used to calculate
the fluctuating pressure strength using Equation
[\[eqn:03\_spherical\_sample\_fit\]](#eqn:03_spherical_sample_fit){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:03_spherical_sample_fit"}.

The results of these measurements of the fluctuating pressure strength
is shown in Table
[\[tab:03\_spherical\_measurement\]](#tab:03_spherical_measurement){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:03_spherical_measurement"}. The differences between the
two techniques for measuring the fluctuating pressure strength fell into
two groups. For the 9-kHz cases, the differences ranged from 20-26%
while the higher frequency cases the differences were between 1.1-1.5%
and in all cases the wavefront measurement reported a higher fluctuating
pressure strength. With the exception of the highest excitation case at
9-kHz, the differences between the to techniques was fairly constant for
each frequency group. Some of these differences maybe attributable to

The 9-kHz case shows some anomalies on the measured wavefront on the
right side, deviating from spherical wave significantly likely
contributing the significantly higher estimated pulsating field strength
value when compared to the microphone estimate. The 14 and 18-kHz cases
show some remarkable agreement between the measured and simulated
images. Optical wavefront measurements can be utilized for making
non-intrusive acoustic field measurements espically when the acoustic
field is simple.

Estimating the Acoustic Field Inside the Test-Section
-----------------------------------------------------

### Mode Marching Process

1.  Start with a known or assumed source acoustic field, $p^n(x,y)$

2.  Calculate the transmitted pressure ratio

    -   Traveling with subsonic flow
        $$\frac{p^t}{p^i} = \left(\frac{1+M_n}{1+M_{n+1}}\right)\left(\frac{2M_{n+1}}{M_n+M_{n+1}}\right)\left(\frac{X_{n,n}}{X_{n,n+1}}\right)\left(\frac{X_{n,n}}{X_{n+1,n+1}}\right)^{1/(\gamma-1)}$$

    -   Traveling against subsonic flow
        $$\frac{p^t}{p^i} = \left(\frac{1-M_n}{1-M_{n+1}}\right)\left(\frac{2M_{n+1}}{M_n+M_{n+1}}\right)\left(\frac{X_{n,n}}{X_{n,n+1}}\right)\left(\frac{X_{n,n}}{X_{n+1,n+1}}\right)^{1/(\gamma-1)}$$

    -   Where $$X_{a,b} = 1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M_aM_b$$

3.  March acoustic field to next axial step,
    $$p^{n+1}(x,y) = p^{n}(x,y)\frac{p^t}{p^i}\exp\{j(\omega t\mp k_{zm}^\pm z)\}$$

4.  Best-fit set of local duct modes coefficients, $C_m$, to acoustic
    field $p^{n+1}(x,y)$

5.  Calculate new acoustic field from duct mode and repeat from step 2
    $$p^n(x,y) = \sum_{m=0}^{M} C_m\cdot p_m(x,y)$$

6.  When the end point is reached, step inlet acoustic field (rotate
    fan) and repeat

Multidimensional Spectral Estimation of Optical Wavefronts {#chap:04_dispersion}
==========================================================

As described in Chapter [1](#chap:01_intro){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:01_intro"}, the objective of this research is to develop
methods to evaluate and, if possible, eliminate the effect of
facility-related acoustic noise on aero-optical measurements. As such,
the first goal of the research is to establish analytical methods to
identify and isolate acoustic sources of optical signals within a given
data sample. This is a significant challenge since, as will be shown
later, acoustic sources of optical aberrations typically have a
magnitude and frequency content that is in the same range as the signal
that is the objective of the measurement. This chapter will begin with a
brief overview of some of the benefits to analyzing multidimensional
data in this way, followed be a short discussion on how these spectrum
are calculated, and conclude with a more in depth discussion on the
analysis of multidimensional spectral estimates.

The multi-dimensional spectral approach that is employed throughout this
research helps identify and characterize acoustic sources of optical
noise as well as aero-optical signals. The spectral approach is also
used as the basis for methods to filter the acoustic sources. For
measurements in multiple dimensions, such as a line of sensors that are
recorded over time, a multidimensional spectral estimation not only
produces temporal frequency content but can also be used to identify the
direction and speed of travel of a particular wave. The benefits of
using multidimensional spectral estimation are shown in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_demo\]](#fig:04_dispersion_demo){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_demo"}.

![Multidimensional spectral estimation plot example and comparison to
traditional power spectrum measurements. A single row of an optical
wavefront measurement was used in this example. The top plot shows the
typical power spectrum averaged over the entire row of data. Both the
middle and bottom plots show the multidimensional spectrum plot with the
y-axis as spacial-frequency in the middle and velocity in the bottom
assuming
$u=f/\xi_x$.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_demo.eps)

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_demo\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_demo
label="fig:04_dispersion_demo"}

A single row of sub-apertures was from an optical wavefront measurement
with a 5-inch diameter beam propagating normally through a wind-tunnel
test section with a free-stream Mach number of 0.5. This measurement was
preformed in the University of Notre Dame Whitefield Wind Tunnel in a
test section that contained a model representing the fuselage of the
AAOL aircraft [@Jumper-2013-8KtN3pue] with window that was flat and
flush to the outer mold line of the fuselage. The top plot shows a
traditional power spectrum ensemble-averaged over the row of data. Both
the blade-passing frequency (517-Hz) and its sub-harmonic had similar
amplitudes with an additional five harmonics showing significant spikes
above the local baseline measurement. There are three additional strong
peaks at approximately 3100, 4850, and 5850 Hz that are likely due to
additional fan vibration that is currently limiting the top speed of the
tunnel.

Both the middle and bottom plots show the multidimensional spectral
estimation plot of two-dimensional measurement. The colorbars were
intentionally not shown in order to allow for all three plots to be
aligned in the temporal-frequency axis and the color is representative
of the logarithm of the power or variance in the wavefront signal (i.e.
$\opdrms^2$) with yellow representing more power and blue representing
less. The colorbar range in this plot is the same is constant with the
other plots throughout this chapter. In the middle plot the y-axis
represents the stream wise spatial frequency, $\xi_x$ with the units of
inverse meters. It is important to note that, unlike
temporal-frequencies, spatial-frequencies can have positive or negative
values depending on the direction of travel of the disturbance; this
means that, waves with positive spatial-frequencies are moving in the
direction of flow. The upstream and downstream traveling signals begin
to diverge at around 2000-Hz with the signal below that point primarily
laying on the upstream traveling side of the plot. The blade-passing
frequency and its various harmonics can also be discerned in the center
plot, by the vertical "streaks" that line up with the peaks in the
standard spectrum shown in the top plot; the center spectral plot shows
that these fan blade-passing signals have significant broadband
spatial-frequency content. All of these narrow-band signals have a
majority of their signal traveling upstream. In addition to optical
disturbances branching off in the upstream and downstream moving
directions there are significant disturbances along zero
spatial-frequency representing a collection of standing waves. Elsewhere
in this paper the multidimensional spectral estimation will be plotted
with the temporal-frequency axis linearly. This data has been plotted
logarithmically along the temporal-frequency axis to better slow the low
frequency content. When plotted linearly, the two primary upstream and
downstream traveling signals lay in a straight line.

A dispersion analysis can be performed on these multidimensional
spectral estimates. In order to obtain the velocity of a given wave we
can start with the most basic forms of the wave equation,
$$\hat{y} = a\exp\{j\theta\} \textrm{,}$$ where $\theta$ is the phase of
the wave and equal to $kx-\omega t$. From here we can take the partial
of $\theta$ with respect to time and set it equal to zero,
$$\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial t} = 0 = \frac{\partial k}{\partial t}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}-\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t}\frac{\partial t}{\partial t} \textrm{,}$$
which can be rearranged to
$$u = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \xi} \textrm{.}$$
If we are to assume that a wave packet intercepts the origin ($f=\xi=0$)
then every point on the spectral plot can be labeled with an assumed
velocity, $$u_{assumed} = \frac{f}{\xi_x} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:04_velocity_assumed}$$

The bottom plot shows the same multidimensional spectral estimation plot
as the middle one but with the y-axis representing an assumed velocity.
There is not much in the way of velocity measurement capability at low
temporal-frequencies The primary optical disturbance moving in the
direction of flow is moving at the free-stream velocity of approximately
175-m/s. The upstream traveling disturbance is traveling at the same
speed but due to the signal being broader is more difficult to measure
this way. The stationary modes in the middle plot are nowhere to be
found on the bottom plot. When the assumed velocity for this these waves
is calculated their speed approaches infinity.

One-Dimensional Power Spectrum Calculation
------------------------------------------

Power spectral analysis is typically performed on one-dimensional data
sets, for example, a single sensor measurement over time. On the other
hand, if a sensor array were used, a multi-dimensional power spectrum
could be computed that would also show spatial frequency information at
each instant in time. For a single-point measurement that varies in
time, $x(t)$, the power spectrum calculation is
$$S_{xx} = \frac{|\fft\{x(t)\}|^2}{Nf_{s}} \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:04_basic_sxx}$$ where $\fft$ is the Fast Fourier Transform,
$N$ is the number of samples, and $f_{s}$ is the sample rate
[@Blackman-1958-4QtKgDb8]. For data that has only a real component the
Fast Fourier Transform function produces magnitude and phase relations
at each frequency step, $f_{s}/N$, over the range from zero-frequency up
to but not including the Nyquist frequency, $f_s/w$, with a mirrored set
of data that can be represented either below (starting at $-f_s/2$) or
above (ending just below $f_s$) this range. The Nyquist frequency not
being included and the mirrored data is due to an assumption that is
integral to the Fourier Transform, which is that the signal is assumed
to be periodic.

The total energy, $\sigma^2$, of the signal must be preserved through
the transform from physical space-time to frequency space
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum x^2(t)}{N} = \Delta f\sum S_{xx}(f) \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:04_fft_energy_conservation}$$ Additionally, because of the
periodic nature of the Fourier Transform and a finite sample length of
discrete data, spectral leakage can cause the power in one frequency bin
to leak into adjacent frequency bins. To minimize this spectral leakage,
windowing functions are employed which typically force the end points of
the signal to zero. The Hann window,
$$w(t) = 1/2\left[1-\cos\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right)\right] \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:04_hann_window}$$ is one of the more commonly used windowing
functions [@Braun-2001-qhqBfvYz] where $w(t)$ is the window function,
$t$ is the time at a given sample, and $T$ is the total sample time.
Since the windowing of a data set changes the signal energy some
correction is needed to be applied. For an arbitrary windowing function
the correction factor, $c_w$, can be obtained by substituting the
windowing function in place of $x(t)$ in Equation
[\[eqn:04\_fft\_energy\_conservation\]](#eqn:04_fft_energy_conservation){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:04_fft_energy_conservation"},
$$c_w = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum w^2(t)/N}} \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:04_window_correction}$$ For a Hann window this correction
factor approaches $\sqrt{8/3}$ as $N$ goes to infinity. When Equation
[\[eqn:04\_basic\_sxx\]](#eqn:04_basic_sxx){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:04_basic_sxx"} is combined with a windowing function and
associated correction the double sided power spectra equation in one
dimension becomes
$$S_{xx} = \frac{|c_w\fft\{x(t) w(t)\}|^2}{Nf_{s}} \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:04_windowed_sxx}$$ A simple MATLAB function for computing
the power spectrum of a one-dimensional signal with an arbitrary
windowing function is shown in Appendix
[\[code:sc\_simpleSXX\]](#code:sc_simpleSXX){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_simpleSXX"}.

N-Dimensional Power Spectra Calculation
---------------------------------------

For measurements with multiple spatial and temporal dimensions the Fast
Fourier Transform is applied $n$-times where $n$ is the total number of
dimensions, with each application in a different dimension,
$$\fftn(x) = \fft(\fft(\cdots\fft(\fft(x,1),2)\cdots,n-1),n) \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:04_fftn}$$ where $\fft(x,n)$ is the Fast Fourier Transform
of $x$ in the $n^{th}$ dimension [@An-1991-QKg7heKm]. For a
$n$-dimensional array the operation becomes [@McClellan-1982-rGQzuZ7t]
$$\mathbf{S_{xx}} =\frac{|c_w\fftn\{f(\mathbf{x}) w(\mathbf{x})\}|^2}{\prod{\overrightarrow{N}\overrightarrow{f_s}}} \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:04_sxxn}$$ where $\mathbf{S_{xx}}$ is the $n$-dimensional
power spectra array or dispersion array, $f(\mathbf{x})$ is a
$n$-dimensional set of data, $w(\mathbf{x})$ is a $n$-dimensional
windowing function, $\overrightarrow{N}$ is a vector denoting the number
of elements in each dimension, $\overrightarrow{f_s}$ is a vector
denoting the sample rate in each dimension, and
$$c_w = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum w^2(\mathbf{x})/\prod{\overrightarrow{N}}}} \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:04_windown}$$ The signal energy conservation relationship
becomes
$$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum\mathbf{x}}{\prod{\overrightarrow{N}}} = \prod{\overrightarrow{\Delta f_s}}\sum\mathbf{S_{xx}} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:04_fftn_energy_conservation}$$ where
$\overrightarrow{\Delta f_s}$ is a vector representing the frequency
step sizes in each dimension. A simple MATLAB code for calculating the
dispersion of $x$ with an arbitrary windowing function is shown in
Appendix
[\[code:sc\_simpleSXXn\]](#code:sc_simpleSXXn){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_simpleSXXn"}.

Non-Rectangular Spatial Windows
-------------------------------

For n-dimensional data sets that fill a rectangular array, a windowing
function can be created by multiplying together a series of
one-dimensional windowing functions in the direction of each dimension.
For non-rectangular data sets, such as is often the case with optical
wavefront measurements, a windowing function can take some additional
steps in its construction. In cases when the spatial measurement
locations are constant throughout time, the windowing function can be
split into two separate components,
$$w(\mathbf{x}) = w_t(t)\cdot w_s(x,y) \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:04_window_sep}$$ the temporal windowing function, $w_t(t)$,
and the spatial windowing function, $w_s(x,y)$. This study uses a Hann
window for the temporal windowing function and a modified Hann window
for the spatial windowing function. For the case of a perfectly circular
aperture, the Hann window can be reformulated to be based on the
normalized radius, $\rho_N$, of the aperture, $$w_s(\rho_N) =
 \begin{cases}
  \frac{1+\cos(\pi\cdot\rho_N)}{2} & \textrm{if } \rho_N < 1 \\
  0                                & \textrm{otherwise.}
 \end{cases}
 \label{eqn:04_window_space}$$ This modified Hann window is
two-dimensional with a value of one at the center of the aperture and
decreases to zero at the edge of the aperture in the same manner as a
Hann windows decreases from the center to either end.

Because the wavefronts measurements often had a clipped edge or some
other obscuration, a different method was employed in this study. For an
arbitrary shaped aperture, the minimum distance from any given
measurement location to the edge of the aperture was used to create the
spatial windows. The minimum distance can be computed given the a set of
points ($x$ and $y$) that spans the measurement range and the set of
points outside of the aperture ($x_O$ and $y_O$),
$$d_{min}(x,y) = \min\left\{\sqrt{(x-x_{O})^2+(y-y_{O})^2}\right\} \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:04_window_space_arb_dist}$$ This distance is then normalized
by the maximum value and the resulting spatial window given a modified
Hann window,
$$w_s(x,y) = \frac{1+\cos\left\{\pi\cdot\left(1-d_{min}^{norm}(x,y)\right)\right\}}{2} \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:04_window_space_arb}$$ This same basic idea can be extended
to data sets where the locations of measurements in space vary with
time.

Wavefront Multidimensional Spectrum
-----------------------------------

At the beginning of this chapter a multidimensional spectral plot for
data resolved in time and one spatial dimension was shown along with a
typical power spectrum plot in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_demo\]](#fig:04_dispersion_demo){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_demo"}. This was shown to facilitate a
simple discussion of some of the benefits of using multidimensional
spectrum analysis on optical wavefronts. That simple analysis was
performed on only a single row of a wavefront data set and provided an
insight into the disturbances that were moving in the horizontal (stream
wise) direction only. When multidimensional spectral estimation is
performed over all dimensions of a wavefront (i.e. time and both spatial
dimensions), as will be done for the remainder of this chapter,
additional detail is available, that also enables the determination of
optical disturbances moving vertically (i.e. cross-stream to the flow)
or any direction in between. Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_comparison\]](#fig:04_dispersion_comparison){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_comparison"} shows a comparison between the
two-dimensional single row spectrum and a three-dimensional spectral
slice showing the horizontal moving optical disturbances at both
zero-vertical spatial frequency and integrated through the vertical
spatial frequencies in order to obtain the two-dimensional spectrum.

![Horizontal moving optical disturbances comparison. The top plot shows
a slice of the three-dimensional spectrum focusing on the plane waves
that are traveling in the horizontal direction. The middle plot is a
recreation of the two-dimensional spectrum by integrating through the
the vertical spatial-frequencies. The bottom plot is the two-dimensional
spectrum.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_comparison.eps)

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_comparison\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_comparison
label="fig:04_dispersion_comparison"}

The top plot shows the three-dimensional spectral estimation plot at
$\xi_y=0\ m^{-1}$, which shows planar waves traveling in the horizontal
direction. The middle plot shows the three-dimensional spectrum
integrated through the vertical spatial-frequency axis creating an
estimate of the two-dimensional spectrum. The bottom plots shows the
two-dimensional spectral plot that was previously shown in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_demo\]](#fig:04_dispersion_demo){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_demo"} but this time with a linear
temporal-frequency axis. Both of the two-dimensional spectrum whether
directly computed or integrated show a significant increase in the
signal content between the acoustic lines ($u\pm c$).

The three-dimensional spectral slice shows signal at the same limits
characteristic velocity limits of the free-stream velocity, $u$, and the
acoustic lines, $u\pm c$, as the two-dimensional spectrum of signal
along with some signal laying along the temporal-frequency axis at
$\xi_y=0\ m^{-1}$. This signal represents a collection of stationary
modes at each temporal-frequency. If this were a flow-related phenomenon
the velocity of the disturbance according to Equation
[\[eqn:04\_velocity\_assumed\]](#eqn:04_velocity_assumed){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:04_velocity_assumed"} would be near infinity; as such, it
is more likely caused by mechanical vibration of the wind tunnel and
components of the optical measurement system. On the three-dimensional
spectrum plot there are signals that run parallel to $u$ and $u-c$ that
do not emanate origin but from $\xi_x\approx\pm80\ m^{-1}$ that show the
assumed velocity is not always valid. [I can't think of a good
explanation for these other than some mean lensing feature that is both
convecting and traveling at $u-c$ and maybe $u+c$. Could be a ghost beam
at a different magnification.]{style="color: red"} There is also an
aliased signal that runs parallel to $u+c$ starting at
$\xi_x\approx-50\ m^{-1}$ and decaying towards the left. Aliased signals
are due to the sample rate, either spatial or temporal, being to low.

The middle plot of Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_comparison\]](#fig:04_dispersion_comparison){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_comparison"} shows the integrated spectrum
through vertical spatial-frequency axis which effectively recreates the
two-dimensional spectrum plot. A reduced order spectrum can be
calculated by $$S_{xx}^{n-1} = \int S_{xx}^n df_s^m \textrm{,}$$ where
$S_{xx}^n$ is the n-dimensional spectrum and $df_s^m$ is the
differential frequency in the $m$-th dimension. This can also be shown
in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_max\]](#fig:04_dispersion_max){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_max"}.

![Recovery of time-based power spectrum from two-dimensional spectral
estimate.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_max.eps)

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_max\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_max
label="fig:04_dispersion_max"}

While the integrated signal over estimated the spectrum going from
three-dimensions to two in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_comparison\]](#fig:04_dispersion_comparison){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_comparison"}, it under estimated the
spectrum going from two to one dimensions. Unfortunately, due to the
limited number of spatial sample points and the large dynamic range of
the signal, this integrated value can contain a significant of error.

Due to the the signal being relatively sparse, a reduced order spectrum
can be estimated by
$$S_{xx}^{n-1} \approx \max(S_{xx}^n,m)f_s^m \textrm{,}$$ where
$\max(S_{xx}^n,m)$ is the maximum value of the spectrum along dimension
$m$ and $f_s^m$ is the sample rate for that dimension. The calculated
temporal power spectrum from the two-dimensional spectrum using the
maximum value is a good estimation at the center of the frequency range
but has some additional decay at both low and high frequencies. The
calculated reduced order spectrum appears to follow the functional form
of actual spectrum but with a significant offset.

### 2-D Slices of the Multidimensional Spectral Estimation

The full multidimensional spectrum contains information of flow features
that are not only moving in the horizontal direction as the
two-dimensional dispersion showed but also in every direction of the
two-dimensional optical wavefront. Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_xy\]](#fig:04_dispersion_xy){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_xy"} shows two-dimensional slices of the
full spectrum that on the top show the horizontal (stream wise) moving
disturbances at $\xi_y=0$ $m^{-1}$ and on the bottom show the vertical
(cross-stream) moving disturbances at $\xi_x=0$ $m^{-1}$.

![Horizontal and vertical moving optical disturbances. This is the same
data as presented in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_demo\]](#fig:04_dispersion_demo){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_demo"} but after calculating the full
three-dimensional spectral estimate. These optical disturbances are
plane waves that are traveling solely in their respective
directions.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_xy.eps)

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_xy\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_xy
label="fig:04_dispersion_xy"}

Since the wavelength is $\lambda=1/\xi$, the waves that make up the
disturbances shown in these slices are plane waves that are traveling
solely in the these directions.

The top plot shows the two-dimensional spectrum for horizontally moving
optical disturbances that was been shown previously. There are three
major flow-related structures that can be observed. The flow-related
structure that lays along $u$ is caused by the boundary layers on both
walls of the wind tunnel. It can be seen that the boundary-layer signal
has a peak at the free-stream velocity, $u$, and has a slight decay as
the velocity decreases towards the dotted line of $0.7u$ with a sharp
decay as the velocity increases. While the boundary layer velocity has
typically be reported as approximately 0.83$u$
[@Gordeyev-2014-jcJndkHM], this data shows the boundary layer velocity
has a range of velocities at each given frequency in which the peak
velocity component has some dependence on the temporal frequency. This
can be more clearly seen in two temporal-frequency slice in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_slices\_velocity\]](#fig:04_dispersion_slices_velocity){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_slices_velocity"}.

![Temporal-frequency slices at 5 and 10-kHz with the various horizontal
velocities
labeled.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_slices_velocity.eps)

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_slices\_velocity\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_slices_velocity
label="fig:04_dispersion_slices_velocity"}

Here the horizontal spatial-frequency has been replaced with the
normalized horizontal velocity. The significant decay of the signal as
the speed increases above the free-stream velocity there is a gradual
decay as the speed decreases. There is also additional signal decay as
the absolute value of the vertical spatial-frequency increases. The
velocity of this boundary layer optical disturbance will be measured in
Chapter [6](#chap:06_single_filter){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:06_single_filter"} using a velocity filter to show a
mean velocity of $0.85u$, which is near the generally accepted value of
$0.83u$ [@Gordeyev-2014-jcJndkHM].

The other two major flow-related structures in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_xy\]](#fig:04_dispersion_xy){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_xy"} are related to acoustic signals
traveling in both directions through the wind-tunnel, denoted by the
dashed and dot-dash lines in the figure. The downstream-traveling
acoustic wave, $u+c$, has a low signal power than the upstream-traveling
acoustic wave, $u-c$. The likely explanation for this difference in
signal power is that most of the acoustic energy in the wind tunnel is
generated by the fan which propagates upstream and downstream within the
wind-tunnel ducting. However, sound waves that move in the flow
direction have their wavelength stretched as the flow is accelerated
into the test-section contraction, while sound waves moving against the
flow have their wavelength contracted. Hence the downstream-traveling
waves have a longer wavelength as they pass through the measurement beam
and thus more of the optical signal from the downstream-travelling waves
is filtered out due to aperture filtering [@Siegenthaler-2008-9Yutbt6c].
At low temporal-frequencies, the blade-passing frequency ( 520-Hz) and
its associated harmonics appear as vertical lines with regular spacing
in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_xy\]](#fig:04_dispersion_xy){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_xy"}.

The two main features on the vertical spectral slice plot on the bottom
of Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_xy\]](#fig:04_dispersion_xy){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_xy"} are the signals moving at the speed of
sound ($\pm c$) including some significant aliasing of these signals.
These two lines represent acoustic waves that are traveling either
straight up or down through the measurement beam. The blade-passing
frequency and its harmonics are also visible in the vertical moving wave
plots in both directions and have much less broadband spatial content in
the vertical direction. Some of the high temporal-frequency narrow-band
signals ( 3, 5, and 6-kHz) contain most of the signal power at the speed
of sound lines in the vertical spectral slice plot. These signals has
some dependence on the free-stream Mach number (see Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_mach\]](#fig:04_dispersion_mach){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_mach"}). These maybe vibrations originating
from the tunnel fan that are currently limiting the top speed of the
tunnel; some older optical wavefronts collected in this tunnel under
similar measurement conditions do not show these narrow-band signals.
Because the portion of these signals with the most power is traveling
vertically through the test section instead of steam wise, the tunnel
walls maybe excited by the fan and resonating.

The stationary modes that have been discussed previously that lay along
the temporal-frequency axis in the horizontal spectral slice plot also
appear in the same location in the vertical spectral slice plot. These
stationary modes appear the be constant when viewed from either
direction and through out time. As a white-noise is generally not
physical unless it is bandwidth limited with a falloff of at least
$1/f^2$ [@Blackman-1958-4QtKgDb8]. Some of these stationary modes are
likely cause by vibrations of various optical elements, especially at
low temporal-frequencies. At higher temporal-frequencies, the stationary
modes maybe related to electronic noise from the high-speed camera,
higher order optical noise from the laser, or even numerical error from
the processing code.

### 3-D Representations of Multidimensional Spectral Estimation

While the two-dimensional slices are fairly informative, particularly
when it comes to signal strength of various flow structures and their
velocities, a three-dimensional plot allows better visualization of the
overall flow structures although some details are lost because typically
only one power level can be plotted at a time. The same data that has
been previously shown in two-dimensional form, is depicted in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_3d\]](#fig:04_dispersion_3d){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_3d"} as an isosurface with a power of
$10^{-14}$ $\mu m^2/Hz/m^{-1}/m^{-1}$ and shown from four different
views.

![Three-dimensional view of the multidimensional spectral plot showing
an isosurface at a power of $10^{-14}$ $\mu m^2/Hz/m^{-1}/m^{-1}$. The
isosurface encompasses 99.9% of the power of the
wavefront.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_3d.eps)

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_3d\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_3d
label="fig:04_dispersion_3d"}

This particular isosurface encompasses approximately 99.9% of the power
of the optical disturbances. The largest feature is the boundary layer
which resembles an ellipsoidal plane that is tilted in the $f-\xi_s$
plane. The other main feature is the acoustic signal which appears as a
cone which is slightly tilted in the direction of upstream-moving
disturbances. The acoustic signal separates into several spikes at high
temporal frequencies some of which are constructive interference from
aliased signal
($\xi_x\approx25\ m^{-1},\ \xi_y\approx\pm60\ m^{-1}, and f\approx20 kHz$)
which is better visualized in the 20-kHz temporal-frequency spectral
slice in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_slices\_velocity\]](#fig:04_dispersion_slices_velocity){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_slices_velocity"}. There may also be a
small number of dominant duct modes at these high temporal-frequencies.
The last feature is the stationary modes which appears as the
cylindrical structure along the center of the plot (near zero
spatial-frequency in x and y), which have a near constant shape and
magnitude through all temporal-frequency ranges.

Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_mach\]](#fig:04_dispersion_mach){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_mach"} shows two views of an isosurface of
the multidimensional spectrum over a range of Mach numbers.

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_mach\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_mach
label="fig:04_dispersion_mach"}

All of these plots are of an isosurface with the same power as used in
Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_3d\]](#fig:04_dispersion_3d){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_3d"}. The stationary modes seems to be
constant throughout the range of Mach numbers indicating that they are
most likely not flow related. The boundary layer signal increases in
power significantly as the Mach number is increased while also the slope
and thus the velocity is significantly increased as well. As shown in
[@Gordeyev-2014-jcJndkHM], the aero-optical $\opdrms$ of the flat-plate
boundary layer on the walls of the wind tunnel is expected to vary
according to
$$\opdrms = BK_{GD}\rho_\infty M^2\delta\sqrt{C_f}G(M) \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:04_opdrms_bl}$$ Hence the significant increase in the power
of the boundary-layer spectrum with Mach number that can be observed in
Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_mach\]](#fig:04_dispersion_mach){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_mach"} is expected based on the $M^2$
dependence in Equation
[\[eqn:04\_opdrms\_bl\]](#eqn:04_opdrms_bl){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:04_opdrms_bl"}. The increase in slope of the
boundary-layer signal is also expected, and is caused by the increase in
the convection speed of the boundary-layer aero-optical disturbances as
the free-stream Mach number increases. The acoustic signal sees some
interesting evolution as well. Along with the strength greatly
increasing with Mach number, the slope of the upstream traveling
disturbances decreases significantly while the downstream moving
acoustic disturbances do not see much change other than an increase in
signal strength.

As the angle of the optical beam changes as it looks through the test
section the horizontal spatial-frequency goes from measuring only the
axial component of the optical disturbance to measuring a combination of
the axial and span wise component. This can be seen in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_angle\]](#fig:04_dispersion_angle){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_angle"} with the same isosurface value as
shown in previous figures and at a Mach number of 0.5.

![Multidimensional spectral estimate isosurfaces of different viewing

are all shown at a power of $10^{-14}$ $\mu m^2/Hz/m^{-1}/m^{-1}$ and

power.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_angle_90.eps "fig:")

power.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_angle_105.eps "fig:")
![Multidimensional spectral estimate isosurfaces of different viewing

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_angle\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_angle
label="fig:04_dispersion_angle"}

The $90^\circ$ case has been shown previously and the vertical component
of the optical disturbance sees little change as the viewing angle is
increase except a small reduction in the boundary layer signal and some
additional signal at the high temporal-frequencies in the acoustic cone.
As the angle is increased the side of the acoustic cone traveling in the
direction of flow is significantly in power, with a large amount of the
signal being aliased into the upstream-traveling side as 'stalactites'
as odd angles. The upstream-traveling acoustic signal is also increased
in power but to a lesser extent. The stationary mode pillar experiences
some change as well as the viewing angle hits $120^\circ$ and is
stretched in the horizontal direction. The effective velocity of the
optical disturbances is reduced for the disturbances traveling in the
same direction as the flow and increased for the disturbances traveling
in the opposite direction.

While these three-dimensional isosurfaces offer some significant insight
into the overall structure of the various optical disturbances they do
not show how the spectral inside of the isosurface is distributed. Views
inside of the isosurface of the horizontal and vertical plane waves were
shown in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_xy\]](#fig:04_dispersion_xy){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_xy"} while Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_slices\]](#fig:04_dispersion_slices){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_slices"} shows slices at various
temporal-frequencies.

![Multidimensional spectral estimate slices at various
temporal-frequencies.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_slices.eps)

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_slices\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_slices
label="fig:04_dispersion_slices"}

The temporal-frequencies spectral slices shown are at: 0-Hz, the
blade-passing frequency at 517-Hz, the second harmonic of the
blade-passing frequency at 1551-Hz, and additional slices at 5, 10, and
20-kHz. The slice at 0 Hz temporal frequency shows the spatial
frequencies of the wavefront disturbance that does not change with time.
This temporally constant wavefront disturbance is typically called the
"mean lensing"component of the wavefront measurement, since it is has an
effect similar to a lens placed in the beam. The mean lensing slice at
0-Hz shows a mostly axisymmetric pattern with most of its power
concentrated at low spatial frequencies. There appear to be the
occasional spike radiating out from the center, most noticeably in line
with the boundary layer signal.

The next four slices, for $f$=517.1-Hz to 10-kHz, show a vertical line
associated with the boundary layers aero-optical disturbance, which
progressively moves towards positive x-spatial frequencies with
increasing frequency. The boundary-layer disturbance appears to be
rotated slightly counter-clockwise indicating that the interrogation
beam is slightly rotated between the test section and the wavefront
sensor. The boundary layer signals at the lower temporal-frequencies
appear to have equal decay in both the positive and negative $\xi_x$
directions while at the higher frequencies, the decay is much more
gradual in the positive $\xi_x$ direction. This could be indicative of
the lower temporal-frequency disturbances in the boundary layer
typically traveling at a more uniform speed very near the free-stream
velocity likely being either in the outer boundary layer or free-stream
tunnel turbulence. The higher temporal-frequency disturbances seem to
have a much wider range of velocities that approach the free-stream
velocity and are likely small structures that reside in different parts
of the boundary layer and hence travel with a wide range of convection
velocities.

The acoustic disturbances show an interesting evolution as the
temporal-frequency increases. At low temporal-frequencies, the acoustic
disturbances are concentrated near zero spatial frequency and with
strong power. At high temporal-frequencies the acoustic disturbances
appear as elliptically shaped rings. At 20-kHz, there are two elliptical
shapes that are easily identifiable, the smaller one is the signal that
is actually present at that frequency while the other one is aliased
data due to the limited temporal sample rate. There is constructive
interference where the two acoustic ring intersect. The 10-kHz slice
also shows a small amount of acoustic aliasing Both the 10 and 20-kHz
acoustic rings show some a non-uniform signal power throughout the
circumference which are also visible in the three-dimensional views as
the spikes at the high temporal-frequencies.

function of temporal-frequency, Mach number, and mode
number.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_sound.eps)

label="fig:04_dispersion_sound"}

### Artificially Increased Sample Rate

In the spectral slices shown in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_xy\]](#fig:04_dispersion_xy){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_xy"}, when a signal crosses a plane
represented by one of the Nyquist frequencies (positive or negative) it
is transposed to the conjugate Nyquist frequency plane and continues on
with the same gradient as before. This behavior is illustrated in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_supersample\]](#fig:04_dispersion_supersample){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_supersample"} using the horizontal and
vertical multidimensional spectrum slices.

![Artificially increased temporal sample rate using a dispersion
analysis. The black box represents original dispersion
plot.](../matlab/04_dispersion_analysis/dispersion_supersample.eps)

[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_supersample\]]{#fig:04_dispersion_supersample
label="fig:04_dispersion_supersample"}

Here the black box represents the original extents of the spectrum,
while outside of the box the spectrum has simply been duplicated and
appended which effectively artificially increases the sample rate. In
this case the spectrum array was tiled in a three-by-three grid for each
of the horizontal and vertical slices. This process has been previously
discussed for two-dimensional spectral plots [@Lynch-2021-DygYkEGU].
Along the spatial Nyquist frequency edges, there is a significant dip in
the signal strength which would result in a spatial super sampling to
have a significant loss of signal at these frequencies.

On the upstream moving disturbance side there is some noticeable
aliasing that is present including a significant spike at 18-kHz
(-80-$m^{-1}$) while aliased and about 31-kHz (-200-$m^{-1}$) when it
has been unaliased. As that upstream moving acoustic disturbance crosses
the spatial Nyquist frequency, the signal strength drops significantly
to local background levels. The boundary layer signal is unfortunately
to well aligned with its tiled self for any aliased data to be
noticeable. The vertically moving disturbances have some significant
temporal aliasing but little to no spatial aliasing.

This process can both of increase the sample rate and de-alias a
multidimensional spectrum but it will also create additional aliased
data. Depending on the downstream analysis to be performed, this
additional aliased signal may need to be filtered out. In cases where
the signal and an aliased data source do not intersect this process
would work when investigating the spectrum along a path with little
issue [@Lynch-2021-DygYkEGU]. Signal interpolation may be needed to
extract the signal from an intersection with aliased data.

There maybe some circumstances when the sample rate cannot be increased
nor aliased data removed, such is likely the case for the boundary layer
signal shown in the horizontal moving disturbances plot because the
signal is directly inline with its aliased self. This may also cause an
issue when trying to analyze the original spectrum, particularly at the
higher frequencies where the aliased data is sufficiently strong and
overlapping the true signal. To avoid this the sample rate velocity,
$$V_s=f/\xi \textrm{,}$$ should sufficiently different enough from the
disturbance's characteristic velocity. This difference will vary for the
depending on the spectral width of the signal. The sample rate velocity
of the spectrum in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_supersample\]](#fig:04_dispersion_supersample){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_supersample"} is 176.4-m/s, the free-stream
velocity is 174.3-m/s and the boundary layer has a significant spectral
with to the signal such that it would be difficult to separate the real
and aliased signals. The upstream-traveling acoustic wave however is a
fairly thin signal that is distinguishable from the aliased signal and
it has a characteristic velocity of -173.0-m/s.

Synthetic Wavefront
===================

In order to best understand how some basic filters preform on a set of
data, a fully known synthetic wavefront was generated such that all of
the various components could be generated separately with the combined
product filtered and compared to the synthetic wavefront containing only
relevant aero-optical data. This is done by creating an input dispersion
plot where each source component is separately generated with parameters
that can be modified to alter the output signal as necessary. Signals
that are assumed to be statistically independent are converted into
dimensional space separately and then summed together. While signals
that are assumed to be related to one another (such as the sound and
vibration components) are summed together in frequency space. Figure
[\[fig:05\_synthetic\_dispersion\_input\]](#fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input"} shows the input
dispersion plot with each signal component separately colored.

![Synthetic wavefront input dispersion plot of an aero-optical signal
and various signal corruption components. The aero-optical signal is

cyan.](../matlab/05_synthetic_wavefront/synthetic_wavefront.eps)

The aero-optical signal is shown in red, the stationary modes in blue,
duct acoustics in magenta, blade-passing frequency related corruption in
green, slowly varying mean-lensing in yellow, and background in cyan.

Wavefronts were generated to approximate the sample conditions in that
the data presented in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_3d\]](#fig:04_dispersion_3d){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_3d"} were measured with. The sample rate
was 200 m$^{-1}$ with 64 ($2^6$) samples in the spatial dimensions and
30,000 Hz with 8192 ($2^{13}$) samples in the temporal dimension. The
speed of sound was chosen to be 340 m/s, with a Mach number of 0.6, and
a boundary layer velocity of 163.2 m/s ($0.8U_\infty$).

The general process of developing most of the component signals was to
determine an approximate shape, normalize it in the appropriate
dimensions, and scale the result by using a function derived from a
hyperbola,
$$\frac{\log_{10}(WF)-b}{b^2}-\frac{\xi_{\rho_N}^2}{a^2} = 1 \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:05_scaling_hyperbola}$$ such that the signal strength at
unity of the normalized radial frequency,
$\log_{10}(WF(\xi_{\rho_N}=1))$, and the limiting slope, $a/b$, are
inputs. This results in the signal strength of the wavefront being
$$\log_{10}(WF) = b-\sqrt{\frac{\xi_{\rho_N}^2}{m^2}+b^2} \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:05_wavefront_strength}$$ where
$$b = \frac{1}{2\log_{10}(WF(\xi_{\rho_N}=1))}\cdot\left(\log_{10}(WF(\xi_{\rho_N}=1))^2-\frac{1}{m^2}\right) \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:05_wavefront_strength_b}$$ The code used to generate the
synthetic wavefront used in this section is shown in Listing
[\[code:sc\_synthetic\_wavefront\]](#code:sc_synthetic_wavefront){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_synthetic_wavefront"}.

Aero-Optical Signal
-------------------

The aero-optical signal which is approximating an optical beam passing
through a boundary layers normal to each of the test section walls. This
signal was approximated by creating an ellipsoid in the plane of the
feature's velocity and normalizing the radius by some arbitrary factors
to roughly match the shape of the measured dispersion plot shown in
Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_3d\]](#fig:04_dispersion_3d){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_3d"}. The dispersion magnitude was then
calculated by applying Equation
[\[eqn:05\_wavefront\_strength\]](#eqn:05_wavefront_strength){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:05_wavefront_strength"}, with relevant code shown on
Lines 19-30 of Listing
[\[code:sc\_synthetic\_wavefront\]](#code:sc_synthetic_wavefront){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_synthetic_wavefront"}. In Figure
[\[fig:05\_synthetic\_dispersion\_input\]](#fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input"} the aero-optical signal
is shown in red.

Stationary Mode Signals
-----------------------

The stationary modes in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_3d\]](#fig:04_dispersion_3d){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_3d"} appear to be temporally white-noise
with the spatial frequencies forming an epicycloid of $k=2$. This shape
was further simplified using a single trigonometric function to
represent the normalization function of the radial spatial frequency,
$$\xi_{\rho_N} = \frac{\xi_\rho}{\xi_{\rho_0}\sqrt{10-6\cos{(2\xi_\theta)}}} \textrm{,}$$
this makes an epicycloidal like shape which has a smooth derivative.
This dispersion component is shown in blue in Figure
[\[fig:05\_synthetic\_dispersion\_input\]](#fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input"} and the relevant code
shown in Lines 61-66 of Listing
[\[code:sc\_synthetic\_wavefront\]](#code:sc_synthetic_wavefront){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_synthetic_wavefront"}.

Sound & Vibration Signals
-------------------------

The sound & vibrating component signals are comprised of two parts. The
first of these is the blade-passing frequency and its harmonic
disturbances (shown in green in Figure
[\[fig:05\_synthetic\_dispersion\_input\]](#fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input"}) and the second is the
acoustic duct modes (shown in magenta). Like the stationary modes, the
blade-passing frequency disturbances were modeled with the simplified
epicycloid narrow-band disc and each harmonic was modulated by using a
low-pass filter offset to the blade-passing frequency. The code for the
blade-passing frequency disturbances is shown in Lines 97-113 of Listing
[\[code:sc\_synthetic\_wavefront\]](#code:sc_synthetic_wavefront){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_synthetic_wavefront"}.

The acoustic duct mode disturbances form a cone which in the $f-\xi_x$
plane is defined by the lines $u\pm c$, while in the $f-\xi_y$ plane is
defined by the speed of sound. At each temporal frequency step an
ellipse was defined based on the constraining lines and the distance to
that ellipse used to calculate a normalized radial frequency. The
strength of the disturbance was decreased logarithmically in temporal
frequency as shown in the code in Lines 183-200 of Listing
[\[code:sc\_synthetic\_wavefront\]](#code:sc_synthetic_wavefront){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_synthetic_wavefront"}.

Mean Lensing Signal
-------------------

The mean-lensing signal (shown in yellow in Figure
[\[fig:05\_synthetic\_dispersion\_input\]](#fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input"}) uses a stretched version
of the simplified epicycloid and represents the slowly varying spatial
disturbance. The relevant code is shown on Lines 144-152 of Listing
[\[code:sc\_synthetic\_wavefront\]](#code:sc_synthetic_wavefront){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_synthetic_wavefront"}.

Background Noise Signal
-----------------------

The background noise disturbance (with a few small spots shown in cyan
in Figure
[\[fig:05\_synthetic\_dispersion\_input\]](#fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:05_synthetic_dispersion_input"}) was the only component
that did not use the hyperbola to scale the signal but instead was just
normally distributed random noise with a mean noise level and deviation
as inputs. The relevant code is shown in Lines 230-234 of Listing
[\[code:sc\_synthetic\_wavefront\]](#code:sc_synthetic_wavefront){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_synthetic_wavefront"}.

Synthetic Wavefront Creation
----------------------------

A synthetic signal can be created from a power spectra by solving for
$x$ in Equation
[\[eqn:05\_basic\_sxx\]](#eqn:05_basic_sxx){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:05_basic_sxx"} and using the Inverse Fast Fourier
Transform,
$$x(t) = \real\left[\ifft\left\{\sqrt{S_{xx}\cdot N\cdot f_{samp}}\cdot\exp{i\phi}\right\}\right] \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:05_ifft}$$ where $\real$ is the real component and $\phi$ is
a random set of phases for each point in the measurement space. As shown
previously this relation can be extended into $n$-dimensions,
$$f(\mathbf{x}) = \real\left[\ifftn\left\{\sqrt{\mathbf{S_{xx}}\cdot\prod{\overrightarrow{N}\cdot \overrightarrow{f}_{samp}}}\cdot\exp{i\mathbf{\phi}}\right\}\right] \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:05_ifftn}$$ Care should be taken when constructing the
random set of phases, as the zero-frequency component has zero phase and
the phases on either side of it are conjugates of one another. The code
for creating a wavefront from a dispersion plot is shown in Lines
336-340 of Listing
[\[code:sc\_synthetic\_wavefront\]](#code:sc_synthetic_wavefront){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_synthetic_wavefront"} and is specifically creating
the wavefront for the aero-optical signal but other signals are
generated using the same basic code. Note that the first three lines are
to get the set of phases properly configured that creates conjugate
phases rotated about the origin.

It was assumed that the aero-optical signal, the stationary modes, and
the background noise were statistically independent of one another and
the sound and vibration combination of modes and as such could be
separately transformed into physical space. While the components of the
sound and vibration sources, the blade-passing frequency, the acoustic
cone, and the mean-lensing, were assumed to be related to one another
and thus were summed together in frequency space prior to being
transformed into physical space. Once the separate components were in
physical space the total wavefront was obtained by summing up the
separate components with the aero-optical signal being a separately
saved along side the total wavefront. Some frames from the synthetic
wavefront are shown in Figure
[\[fig:05\_synthetic\_frames\]](#fig:05_synthetic_frames){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:05_synthetic_frames"} with the total wavefront shown on
top and the aero-optical only signal shown on the bottom.

Flow is from right to left. The aero-optical signal is often times
noticeable in the total wavefront signal, but can be easily overpowered
by the various contamination sources.

Comparison to Measured Data
---------------------------

A dispersion plot of the total synthetic wavefront is shown in Figure

In this view the aero-optical signal is more noticeable but there still
remains some significant overlap with the various contamination sources.

frequency was depicted as symmetric in the synthetic wavefront while
measured data (shown in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_3d\]](#fig:04_dispersion_3d){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_3d"}) shows more signal on the side
traveling in the direction of flow. The harmonics of the BPF are more on
the upstream traveling side of the dispersion and are a little less
pronounced in the measured data. The total synthetic wavefront has a
spatial time-averaged RMS of $0.0112\pm0.0006\mu m$ with the
aero-optical only signal having a spatial time-averaged RMS of
$0.0073\pm0.0003\mu m$. The measured wavefront presented in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_3d\]](#fig:04_dispersion_3d){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_3d"} had a spatial time-averaged RMS of
$0.0874\pm0.0263\mu m$. The overall spatial RMS of the synthetic
wavefront was $12.8\%$ when compared to the measured wavefront
indicating that the algorithms used to generate the wavefront are not
representative of reality and can provide a future path of research in
order to produce more realistic synthetic wavefronts. [Double Check line

Single Sensor Filtering Techniques {#chap:06_single_filter}
==================================

[Show some dispersions of POD modes and discuss whether or not POD
filtering maybe a viable option.]{style="color: red"}

A filter is a function, $G(\mathbf{\omega})$, that describes the gain a
signal will experience in frequency space. In the simplest case, the
filtered signal is the inverse Fourier transform of the gain multiplied
by the Fourier transform of the signal. Additionally, a windowing
function, $W(\mathbf{x})$, can be used to help suppress finite sampling
effects,
$$f_F(\mathbf{x}) = \real\left(\frac{\ifftn[G(\mathbf{\omega})\cdot\fftn\{f(\mathbf{x})\cdot W(\mathbf{x})\}]}{W(\mathbf{x})}\right) \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:06_filter_function}$$ where $f$ is the signal function and
$f_F$ is the filtered signal. Depending on the windowing function some
data could be destroyed during this process if there is a zero present
due to the possibility of dividing by zero.

A basic MATLAB code for applying a filter to a wavefront using a
separate function for both generating and applying the gain function
which is presented in Listing
[\[code:sc\_basic\_wavefront\_filters\]](#code:sc_basic_wavefront_filters){reference-type="ref"
reference="code:sc_basic_wavefront_filters"}. This code generates a
windowing function as described by Equations
[\[eqn:04\_hann\_window\]](#eqn:04_hann_window){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:04_hann_window"},
[\[eqn:04\_window\_sep\]](#eqn:04_window_sep){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:04_window_sep"}, and
[\[eqn:04\_window\_space\_arb\]](#eqn:04_window_space_arb){reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:04_window_space_arb"}. The temporal windowing function
was generated with an additional two terms such that the end points
which are equal to zero could be removed to prevent the first and last
frames from being destroyed. Likewise, the spatial window used the
arbitrary aperture function which ensures that all of the points inside
of the aperture are non-zero. In some cases, a windowing function was
not used due to filtered wavefront having a far greater magnitude in
some places despite the precautions used. The filter presented in this
code sample is a second order temporal high-pass filter with a cut-off
frequency of 2000 Hz. The function `WFfilter` takes input based on a
normalized cut-point in reference to the sample rate.

Temporal Filter Methods
-----------------------

The methods presented in this section are based on Butterworth filters
[@Butterworth-1930-DvDrjKha] but could easily be extended to other types
of filters. The basic gain function,
$$G(f) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{f}{f_c}\right)^{\pm2n}}} \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:06_butterworth}$$ where $f_c$ is the cut-off frequency, $n$
is the filter order (number of filters in a series), and $\pm$
represents either a low-pass ($+$) or high-pass ($-$) filter. In this
particular formulation, only the magnitude is attenuated, circuit based
Butterworth filters or their digital copies will have some variable
phase attenuation as well. Additionally, a band-pass filter can be
constructed by placing a low-pass in series with a high-pass filter and
a band-stop by placing the two types in parallel.

As a large portion of the wavefront contamination is at low frequencies,
a high-pass filter is the most useful in temporal space for removing
unwanted contamination, as shown in Figure
[\[fig:06\_filter\_temporal\]](#fig:06_filter_temporal){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:06_filter_temporal"}.

![OPD time-averaged spatial-RMS of high-pass temporal filters relative
to the aero-optical only unfiltered
wavefront.](../matlab/06_single_sensor_filtering/filter_temporal.eps)

[\[fig:06\_filter\_temporal\]]{#fig:06_filter_temporal
label="fig:06_filter_temporal"}

This figure shows the time-averaged spatial-RMS of both the total and
aero-optical only wavefronts with various cut-off high-pass filters
relative to that of the aero-optical only wavefront unfiltered. The
total wavefront ratio crosses unity around 1200 Hz, which is about
halfway between the second and third harmonic of the blade-passing
frequency in this simulated wavefront. While approximately 75% of the
aero-optical signal remains at this cut-off frequency, that difference
is made up by the remaining contamination. This can provide a
computationally cheap way estimating the aero-optical portion of the
wavefront for calculations that rely on the spatial-RMS of a wavefront.
While it is easy to determine a cut-off frequency for this synthetic
wavefront, a measured wavefront will likely take some knowledge or
expectation of the contamination that is present in the measurement.

An example of band-pass and band-stop filtering is shown if Figure
[\[fig:06\_filter\_temporal\_bandpass\]](#fig:06_filter_temporal_bandpass){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:06_filter_temporal_bandpass"}.

![Measured wavefronts filtered at the blade-passing frequency
(532$\pm$10 Hz). The left column is band-stop filtered while the right
is band-pass
filtered.](../matlab/06_single_sensor_filtering/filter_temporal_bandpass.eps)

[\[fig:06\_filter\_temporal\_bandpass\]]{#fig:06_filter_temporal_bandpass
label="fig:06_filter_temporal_bandpass"}

The figure shows measured data that is band-stop filtered in the left
column and band-pass filtered in the right column in several different
frames. The flow is from right-to-left and the band-pass filtered
wavefront clearly shows upstream-moving optical disturbances associated
with acoustic duct modes traveling upstream from the fan. The band-stop
shows a much slower moving optical disturbance that is in general moving
in the direction of the flow, but it still possess the optical
disturbances of the blade-pass frequency harmonics.

One thing of note, MATLAB's builtin filter functions only work in
one-dimension of frequency space and are unable to determine the
direction that a signal is traveling. They also only apply the filter to
the positive frequencies and zero-out the negative ones which both
reduces the signal by two and also switches all disturbances to moving
in the same direction. So even for a filter that operates in
one-dimension, it is best to apply the filter over both positive and
negative frequencies to the n-dimensional Fourier transform in order to
preserve the direction of travel of a signal. This additionally allows
several filters to be applied in series with one another without having
to perform a Fourier and inverse Fourier transform for each successive
filter. [I should maybe show this matlab filter issue in an
appendix.]{style="color: red"}

Some additional uses of temporal filters would be in sizing and/or
designing an adaptive optics system. A low-pass filter with a cut-off at
the bandwidth of either a fast-steering or deformable mirror would help
determine the signal that a system would need to reject. A control
system may need to have the bandwidth reduced in order to keep a
mirror's travel within limits. While a high-pass filter would inform
designers of the remaining optical aberrations that cannot be corrected.

Upstream/Downstream Moving
--------------------------

For the filtering of upstream and downstream moving optical disturbances
a logistic function was chosen,
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp\{-kx\}} \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:06_logistic}$$ This function needs to be expanded into
two-dimensions ($x$ and $t$) with the filter ideally returning a value
of one in both the first and third quadrants and zero otherwise for a
filter outputs disturbances moving in the direction of flow. To
accomplish this the logistic curve in each dimension is scaled and
offset to output values between negative one and positive one,
$$G_t(f) = \frac{2}{1+\exp\{-k_tf\}}-1
 \label{eqn:06_logistic_time}$$ and
$$G_x(\xi_x) = \frac{2}{1+\exp\{\pm k_x\xi_x\}}-1 \textrm{,}
 \label{eqn:06_logistic_space}$$ where $\pm$ determines whether the
filter is obtaining upstream traveling disturbances ($+$) or downstream
traveling ($-$). These two gain functions are then multiplied together
and scaled to output values between zero and one,
$$G(\xi_x,f) = \frac{(G_t\cdot G_x)+1}{2} \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:06_up_down_filter}$$ As the values of $k_x$ and $k_t$ go to
infinity an ideal case is obtained. Downstream traveling disturbances
have a gain of one in the first and third quadrants, zero in the second
and forth quadrants, and a value of $1/2$ when either frequency is zero.

The dispersion analysis using an ideal downstream moving filter on the
synthetic wavefront is shown in Figure
[\[fig:06\_filter\_downstream\]](#fig:06_filter_downstream){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:06_filter_downstream"} along side the dispersion of the
unfiltered wavefront.

![Dispersion isosurface of the synthetic wavefront with a downstream
filter in
place.](../matlab/06_single_sensor_filtering/filter_downstream.eps)

[\[fig:06\_filter\_downstream\]]{#fig:06_filter_downstream
label="fig:06_filter_downstream"}

All of the upstream traveling disturbances are removed and the
disturbances at $\xi_x=0$ m$^{-1}$ are significantly reduced. Some of
the stationary modes remain while only the acoustic and vibration
signals that are propagating in the direction of flow remain. The
aero-optical signal is clipped slightly at $\xi_x=0$ due to the spatial
width of the signal. The ratio of the time-averaged spatial-RMS of the
filtered signal when compared to the aero-optic only signal was 1.24
while the unfiltered ratio was 1.53. When the filter was applied to only
the aero-optic signal the ratio was 0.96. This filter method will retain
any disturbance that is traveling in the direction of flow. Even with an
ideal filter there is some slight attenuation of the aero-optical signal
due to signal having some spectral width that crosses into
upstream-moving portion of the dispersion plot.

Velocity Filtering
------------------

The dispersion plot shows flow structures that are traveling at a given
speed as having a constant slope. A plane in the dispersion plot can be
used to measure a flow structure's velocity in both $x$ and
$y$-directions. The distance from any given point in the dispersion plot
to a plane described by the velocities $v_x$ and $v_y$ can be computed
by $$d = \frac{|v_x\xi_x+v_y\xi_y-f|}{\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+1}} \textrm{.}
 \label{eqn:06_dist_point_2_plane}$$ A low-pass or high-pass filter can
then be used to retain only disturbances that are traveling at that
velocity, or to exclude those disturbances respectively.

A low-pass velocity-filter of the synthetic wavefront is shown in Figure
[\[fig:06\_filter\_velocity\]](#fig:06_filter_velocity){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:06_filter_velocity"}.

![Dispersion isosurface of the synthetic wavefront with a low-pass
velocity-filter in
place.](../matlab/06_single_sensor_filtering/filter_velocity.eps)

[\[fig:06\_filter\_velocity\]]{#fig:06_filter_velocity
label="fig:06_filter_velocity"}

The filtered dispersion plot shows primarily only the aero-optic signal
remains with some additional low-frequency content from the
blade-passing frequency and harmonic disturbances as well as some
stationary and acoustic disturbances. The ratio of the time-averaged
spatial-RMS relative to that of the aero-optical only signal went from
1.53 in the unfiltered case to 1.01 in the filtered case. This method
can provide a very effective way in quickly estimating the clean
spatial-RMS of a contaminated wavefront.

Another use of the synthetic wavefront is measuring the speed of a
broadband disturbance such as the aero-optical signal of a boundary
layer. This is done by finding the velocity that maximizes the output
spatial-RMS of the velocity filter, see Figure
[\[fig:06\_filter\_velocity\_measure\]](#fig:06_filter_velocity_measure){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:06_filter_velocity_measure"}.

![Velocity low-pass filter used to determine the mean disturbance
velocity. The maximum value corresponds with the actual value used in
the creation of the synthetic
wavefront.](../matlab/06_single_sensor_filtering/filter_velocity_measure.eps)

[\[fig:06\_filter\_velocity\_measure\]]{#fig:06_filter_velocity_measure
label="fig:06_filter_velocity_measure"}

In this case boundary layer speed was determined to be 163 m/s which
corresponds to the design velocity of the synthetic signal of $0.8U$. If
the velocity range used is to large, a false result can be obtained due
to the inclusion of disturbance structures not related to the
aero-optical signal. For signals that have a mean-velocity component
that is not aligned with an axis both velocity components can be varied
as shown in Figure
[\[fig:06\_filter\_velocity\_real\]](#fig:06_filter_velocity_real){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:06_filter_velocity_real"}.

![Velocity low-pass filter used to determine the mean disturbance
velocity of measured data presented in Figure
[\[fig:06\_dispersion\_real\]](#fig:06_dispersion_real){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:06_dispersion_real"}. The velocity in the x-direction was
measured to be 207 m/s and -17 m/s in the
y-direction.](../matlab/06_single_sensor_filtering/filter_velocity_real.eps)

[\[fig:06\_filter\_velocity\_real\]]{#fig:06_filter_velocity_real
label="fig:06_filter_velocity_real"}

In this case a variable low-pass velocity filter was employed with a
high-pass spatial filter operating in the radial direction. This helped
eliminate some of the low-frequency stationary disturbances as well as
some of the disturbances related to the blade-passing frequency. The
velocity was measured using the optical disturbances in the dispersion
plot to be approximately 207 m/s in the x-direction and -17 m/s in the
y-direction.

Basic Filter Summary
--------------------

Three different basic wavefront filters were shown and discussed in this
chapter. The temporal filter is most useful when separating an optical
wavefront into frequency bands. Adaptive optics system performance can
be evaluated by using both high-pass and low-pass temporal filters.
High-pass filters can be used to determine a systems performance that
cannot be corrected while low-pass filters can be used to sizing the
travel of active optical components. Band-pass filters are helpful in
analyzing a wavefront over a narrow-band to examine the optical
aberrations at specific frequencies that significantly contribute to the
overall optical disturbance.

Filters that separate upstream and downstream-moving disturbances are
useful as most of the optical contamination comes from acoustic signals
that are traveling upstream form a wind-tunnel fan. These filters would
also be useful for separating out an aero-optical signal that has a
broad range of velocities that can occur in a span wise measurement of a
boundary layer. [Use some of sontag's data and site his
dissertation.]{style="color: red"}

The velocity filter is the most useful for isolating the aero-optical
portion of a wavefront measurement given the aero-optical signal has a
fairly narrow and constant velocity range. By using this filter to
maximize the power over a range of velocities it can be used to measure
the speed in both x and y-directions of an optical disturbance.

:::

The previous chapter investigated filtering optical wavefront corruption
by applying a variety of filters to the wavefront in the
multi-dimensional spectral domain. These techniques involve only data
from the optical wavefront itself and user knowledge and experience to
obtain filtered data. When additional data streams are available, such
as from microphones or accelerators, a targeted filter mechanisms become
available.

A previous study [@DeLucca-2014-RAJvGdv7] focused on using the
combination of linear stochastic estimation (LSE) and spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) to remove vibration related
contamination from aero-optical wind-tunnel measurements. This process
along with optical tip and tilt removal showed approximately an 85%
reduction in the measured $\opdrms$ by combining accelerator
measurements with optical wavefront measurements.

Optical Tip and Tilt
--------------------

Zernike polynomials are traditionally used for describing optical
aberrations of a optical system [@Born-1965-HHGYgjdH]. These polynomials
are defined on the unit circle and form a set of orthogonal functions,
$$Z_n^m(\rho,\theta) = R_n^m(\rho)\cos(m\theta)
  \label{eqn:07_zernike}$$ where $R_n^m(\rho)$ is the radial basis
function and $\cos(m\theta)$ is the angular basis function. For values
of $-m$ the angular basis function becomes $\sin(m\theta)$. The radial
basis function are developed from Jacobi polynomials but for purposes in
this study, only a few simple ones will be used. An optical wavefront
can be approximated by a summation of Zernike polynomials multiplied by
their corresponding coefficients $$\wf \approx \sum Z_ja_j \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:07_zernike_coeff}$$

The Noll naming scheme is an method of organizing the Zernike
polynomials into a single notation of $Z_j$, along with normalizing each
polynomial to have a spatial RMS equal to one [@Noll-1976-HHKzd88f]. The
first three of these using the Noll naming scheme are piston, tip, and
tilt. Piston is simply the average $\opd$ value of the single wavefront
frame $$Z_1 = 1 \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:07_zernike_1}$$ Tip and tilt are the best planar fit to the
$\opd$ along the x-axis and y-axis respectively where tip is
$$Z_2 = 2\rho\cos\theta \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:07_zernike_2}$$ and tilt is
$$Z_3 = 2\rho\sin\theta \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:07_zernike_3}$$ Once the coefficients for these modes are
solved for they can be filtered out $$WF^F = WF-\sum Z_ja_j \textrm{.}$$

LSE-SPOD
--------

The LSE-SPOD technique starts with performing SPOD on the primary data
set and then using the Fourier transforms of the additional sensor data
to perform a filtering operation. The spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition technique is described in detail by Schmidt and Colonius
[@Schmidt-2020-m2emACkX]. A schematic of the SPOD algorithm is shown in
Figure
[\[fig:07\_spod\_algorithm\]](#fig:07_spod_algorithm){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:07_spod_algorithm"}.

![Schematic of the SPOD algorithm (taken from [@Schmidt-2020-m2emACkX]).
The numbers in parentheses denote the equations
used.](../other-sources/schmidt_2020_figure_01.jpeg "fig:") (-20,235)
(-230,210) (-20,102) (-231,69)

[\[fig:07\_spod\_algorithm\]]{#fig:07_spod_algorithm
label="fig:07_spod_algorithm"}

The algorithm begins by separating the original data set, $Q$, into a
number of smaller blocks, $$Q = \left[
  \begin{matrix}
    \mid & \mid & & \mid \\
    q^{(1)} & q^{(2)} & \cdots & q^{(N)} \\
    \mid & \mid & & \mid
  \end{matrix}
  \right]\textrm{,}\quad Q\in\mathbb{C}^{M\times N}
  \label{eqn:07_data_block}$$ where $M$ is the total number of degrees
of freedom (number of spatial points times the block length in time) and
$N$ is the number of blocks. Each block is then Fourier Transformed in
the temporal dimension or through all dimensions. Once in the frequency
domain the data blocks are then reorganized by creating new blocks of
identical temporal-frequencies, $$\hat{Q} = \left[
  \begin{matrix}
    \mid & \mid & & \mid \\
    \hat{q}^{(1)} & \hat{q}^{(2)} & \cdots & \hat{q}^{(N)} \\
    \mid & \mid & & \mid
  \end{matrix}
  \right]\textrm{,}\quad \hat{Q}\in\mathbb{C}^{M\times N}
  \label{eqn:07_frequency_block}$$ where $M$ is now the number of
spatial points times the number of blocks and $N$ is block length in
time. Proper orthogonal decomposition is then performed separately on
each temporal-frequency block via either traditional POD
$$\hat{C} = \frac{1}{N-1}\hat{Q}\hat{Q}^H \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:07_pod_01}$$
$$\hat{C}W\hat{\Phi}=\hat{\Phi}\hat{\Lambda} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:07_pod_02}$$ or the method of snapshots,
$$\hat{Q}^HW\hat{Q}\hat{\Psi}=\hat{\Psi}\hat{\Lambda} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:07_pod_03}$$ $$\hat{\Phi}=\hat{Q}\hat{\Psi} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:07_pod_04}$$ where $H$ denotes the Hermitian transpose, $W$
is a weighting matrix, $\Phi$ is the set of deterministic spatial
functions, $\Lambda$ is the eigen-values, and $\Psi$ is the coefficient
matrix.

The linear stochastic estimation portion of the technique is described
by Adrian [@Adrian-1975-VenaZyuv]. This process uses a linear sum,
$L_{ij}$, of additional measurements, $y_j$, to approximate a measured
signal, $x_i$, $$x_i^{LSE}=L_{ij}y_j \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:07_lse_01}$$ where
$$L_{ij} = \langle x_iy_k\rangle\langle y_jy_k\rangle^{-1} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:07_lse_02}$$ When combined with SPOD, the estimation
matrix, $L$, becomes
$$L=(\hat{\Psi}\hat{y}^H)(\hat{y}\hat{y}^H)^{-1} \textrm{,}
  \label{eqn:07_lse_spod_01}$$ which allows for an estimated version of
the coefficient matrix to be calculated
$$\hat{\Psi}^E=L\hat{y} \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:07_lse_spod_02}$$ The estimated coefficient matrix contains
portions of the original signal that best resemble the additional sensor
data. Assuming that the additional sensor data represents signal
contamination of the original signal, a filtered coefficient matrix can
be computed from the difference between the original and estimated
coefficient matrix. $$\hat{\Psi}^F=\hat{\Psi}-\hat{\Psi}^E \textrm{.}
  \label{eqn:07_lse_spod_03}$$ A filtered signal, $Q^F$ can be
constructed by using the filtered coefficient matrix and the spatial
functions, $$\hat{Q} = \hat{\Psi}^F\hat{\Phi}^H \textrm{.}$$

Filtering Experimental Data
---------------------------

This filtering technique was tried with the same data sets that were
shown in Figure
[\[fig:04\_dispersion\_mach\]](#fig:04_dispersion_mach){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:04_dispersion_mach"}. Both simultaneous accelerometer and
microphone were made along side the optical wavefront measurements. The
locations of some of the additional sensors are shown in Figure
[\[fig:07\_sensor placement\]](#fig:07_sensor placement){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:07_sensor placement"}.

![The locations of some of the additional sensors used in the LSE-SPOD
filtering.](../photos/IMG_9655.jpeg){width="90%"}

[\[fig:07\_sensor placement\]]{#fig:07_sensor placement
label="fig:07_sensor placement"}

Two microphones were used for ambient measurement (a ACO 7016B
[@ACO-Microphones] and a Brüel & Kjær 4939 [@Bruel-Kjaer-4939]), four
microphones were used for test-section noise measurement (PCB 103B02
[@PCB-103B02-C]), and ten accelerometers were located throughout the
setup (PCB 352C33 [@PCB-352C33-H]). One of the ambient microphones was
mounted to the top of the optics bench facing the test-section and can
be seen in Figure
[\[fig:07\_sensor placement\]](#fig:07_sensor placement){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:07_sensor placement"} just to the right of the primary
lens and the other ambient microphone was hanging below the optics bench
end towards the test-section.

The test-sections microphones were in groups of two either upstream or
downstream from the optical beam by about 20-inches, with the upstream
microphone locations viewable in Figure
[\[fig:07\_sensor placement\]](#fig:07_sensor placement){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:07_sensor placement"}. The model installed in the
test-section represents the outside of an aircraft fuselage with a
5-foot diameter and is angled to account for the aircraft's
angle-of-attack for steady-level-flight at cruise. This results in the
fuselage model being shifted approximately 2-inches higher from the
test-section centerline upsteam at the microphone location. The duct
microphones were placed about 2.75-inches from the model centerline.

There were six accelerometers attached to the test-section windows, with
three being on each side. The locations of the three accelerometers on
the model side can be seen in Figure
[\[fig:07\_sensor placement\]](#fig:07_sensor placement){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:07_sensor placement"}, the three accelerometers on the
other window used the opposite pattern (two high and one low). One
accelerometer was placed on the primary lens (also shown) and one was
placed in the center of the optics bench. The last two accelerometers
were located on the return mirror and oriented in a way to measure the
tip and tilt of the return beam.

The power-spectra of all of the sensors at the three Mach numbers are
shown in Figure
[\[fig:07\_sensor\_spectra\]](#fig:07_sensor_spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:07_sensor_spectra"}.

![Power-spectra of the additional sensor measurements at the three Mach
numbers tested. The x-axis is in Strouhal number per characteristic
length
($St/l$).](../matlab/07_multiple_sensor_filtering/sensor_spectra.eps)

[\[fig:07\_sensor\_spectra\]]{#fig:07_sensor_spectra
label="fig:07_sensor_spectra"}

These plots are presented as Strouhal number per characteristic length
with the different groups of sensors shown together. The blade-passing
frequency for these data sets is at a $St/l$ of approximately 3-$m^{-1}$
with a clear and consistant narrow-band signal at for but the $M=0.3$
run which has a slight increase in signal for some of the sensors. For
the $M=0.5$ case there is an additional strong narrow-band signal at
20-$m^{-1}$ for all sensors and a slightly broader signal at 38-$m^{-1}$
that is only present in the test-section mounted sensors that may be due
to extra fan vibration which is currently limiting the top speed of the
wind-tunnel. The test-section mounted microphones are picking up
boundary layer accoustic noise above $St/l$ of approximately
20-$m^{-1}$.

Two variants of this filtering technique were tried. The first was a
standard LSE-SPOD technique in which the spectral POD was performed on
the data set that was Fourier transformed in time only. The second will
be referred to here as LSE-MSPOD, in which the spectral POD was applied
to a data set in which the Fourier transformed was performed in all
dimensions of space and time. Figures

These plots show a combination of the isosurface and horizontal moving
plane-wave slice. Both of these methods preformed effectively identical
to one another with a drop of 14.2% drop in overall RMS value of the
filtered wavefront (both time and space). There is a significant drop in
the signal at the blade-passing frequency and its harmonics, especially
at the higher spatial frequencies. The stationary signal information is
also significantly reduced along with the high temporal-frequency
acoustic signal. The aero-optical boundary layer signal is also
partially reduced, which is most noticeable at higher
temporal-frequencies. Some of this lost signal can be restored by
increasing the overlap of the temporal frequency blocks, but this also
restores some of the unwanted high temporal-frequency contamination.

Table
[\[tab:07\_lse\_mspod\_table\]](#tab:07_lse_mspod_table){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:07_lse_mspod_table"} shows the time averaged $\opdrms$ of
three different data sets at a beam angle through the test-section of
$90^\circ$. The data sets were at Mach numbers of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 that
had an unfiltered $\opdrms$ of 0.0561, 0.0521, and 0.0824 $\mu m$
respectively. Note that in the raw processed wavefronts for the Mach
number of 0.3 was higher than the 0.4 case. There was a significant drop
of between 62.6 and 78.6% in the $\opdrms$ by removing the Zernike modes
corresponding to tip and tilt. It is at this point the Mach number of
0.4 case has a higher $\opdrms$ than the 0.3 case as would be expected .

Five different combinations of additional sensors were examined for
filtering with the LSE-MSPOD process. The first set was all of the
accelerometers which resulted in an additional drop in $\opdrms$ of
between 3 and 5%. The second and third sets used either the ambient or
duct microphones and those sets had slightly less reduction than the
accelerometers resulted in. The forth set was the test-section sensors
that was comprised of six window mounted accelerometers and four duct
mounted microphones. This set of sensors preformed the same as all of
the accelerometers, while the use of all of the additional sensors in
the last set performed the best, with an additional reduction in
$\opdrms$ of 4 to 6% from the tip/tilt removal cases.

A velocity filter was also tried in addition to just the tip/tilt
removal or in conjunction with tip/tilt and all the sensors being used
in the LSE-MSPOD process. The velocity filter performed better than the
all sensors removal case by an additional 1.5 to 3%. When all sensors
were used with LSE-MSPOD on the velocity filtered wavefronts an
additional 3 to 4% of the $\opdrms$ was removed from just the velocity
filtered case or an additional 8.1% reduction for only doing tip/tilt
removal on the Mach number of 0.3 case or 14.1 and 13.3% reduction for
the 0.4 and 0.5 Mach number cases.

Using either the temporal or multi-dimensional version of the LSE-SPOD
filtering technique can help remove some of the narrow-band acoustic and
vibration reduction in an optical wavefront. This additional reduction
does seem to be somewhat tied to the number of sensors used with more
sensors having a greater impact on the signal reduction. Since the
vibrations and acoustics have the same primary source, the wind-tunnel
fan, they seems to do a relatively equivalent job at filtering the
optical contamination. Accelerometers have a benefit easier installation
but the microphones do not necessary have to be installed inside of the
wind-tunnel.
